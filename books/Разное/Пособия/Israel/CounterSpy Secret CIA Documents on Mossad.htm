<h4 align="CENTER"><i>CounterSpy</i> Introduction</h4>

<p><img src="CounterSpy%20Secret%20CIA%20Documents%20on%20Mossad_files/secret.jpg" width="153" vspace="8" hspace="8" height="388" border="0" align="right">The
 secret CIA and State Department documents printed here have come a long
 way. They were discovered by the Iranian students who took over the 
U.S. Embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979. Some were complete, others 
which had gone through a shredding machine were painstakingly pieced 
together.

</p><p>These documents, made available to <i>CounterSpy</i> by 
journalists Randy Goodman, Terri Taylor and William Worthy, are only a 
fraction of a 13 volume paperback set (complete with commentary) readily
 available for sale in Iran. The three journalists picked up a set at an
 airport on their way to Shiraz. In late November 1981 they had 
completed their assignment for CBS and flew home. The FBI and Customs 
officials seized their luggage and confiscated the documents — with the 
active assistance of Lufthansa (West German) Airlines.

</p><p>But a second set of the books — sent by another route — was 
overlooked by customs and reached the U.S. intact. (Some of the volumes 
were supplied to the <i>Washington Post</i> which analyzed them in a series running from January 31 to February 6, 1982.)

</p><p>The 13 volumes of documents are a goldmine. They expose covert 
CIA operations in Iran (an attempt to recruit former Prime Minister Bani
 Sadr, for example), reveal the CIA's use of corporate covers, and 
detail former Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan's attempts to establish ties
 with U.S.&nbsp;intelligence.

</p><p>The documents supplied to <i>CounterSpy</i> deal with the triangle of U.S.-Israeli-Iranian relations. A&nbsp;careful reading of the documents illustrates that the <i>Washington Post</i>'s
 analysis was narrowly focussed on the "U.S. angle." Other disclosures 
were simply glossed over — systematic Israeli suppression of domestic 
dissent, for example, or Mossad (Israel's CIA) and Israeli military 
intelligence support for repressive regimes in Africa, Asia and Latin 
America, and even Mossad's "psycholgical warfare projects."

</p><p>The main document reprinted here is an in-depth CIA analysis of 
Israeli intelligence, written in March 1979 and classified secret. Other
 documents [not included in this online version] are cables between the 
State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, most of them discussing
 U.S.-Israeli-Iranian relations (documenting the close collaboration 
between Mossad and the Shah's intelligence agency SAVAK).

<a name="1"></a><h3>A.&nbsp; General</h3>

<p>Israel's principal intelligence and security authority is the <i>Va'adat Rashei Hasherlim</i>
 (the Committee of the Heads of the Services), generally know as the 
Va'adat. It coordinates the operations and activities of its members. <i>Mossad Letafkidim Meyouchadim</i>
 (the Secret Intelligence Service) or Mossad, its common name, has the 
primary responsibility for foreign operations and is subordinate to the 
Prime Minister. <i>Sherut Bitachon Kiali</i> (Counterespionage and 
Internal Security), popularly known as Shin Beth, is responsible for 
security and is directly subordinate to the Prime Minister. <i>Agaf Modiin</i>
 (Military Intelligence) has the main responsiblity for strategic 
militrary intelligence and communications intelligence and is under the 
command of the Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defense Forces. The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides support in research and political 
planning to the Israel intelligence community. The Ministry of Interior 
assists the National Police with police investigations and the 
maintenance of border security.

<a name="2"></a></p><h4>1.&nbsp; Background and development of services</h4>

<p>In 1948, when the British Mandate ended, the Jewish population of 
Palestine established the State of Israel. Among the agencies of 
government to emerge was the intelligence and security unit known as the
 Information Service (<i>Sherut Yedioth</i> — popularly known as Shay). 
This organization, which was the intelligence arm of the Zionists' 
underground resistance force, the Haganah, during the years of the 
British Mandate, had begun to engage in operations on a worldwide scale 
with the founding of the Jewish Agency in 1929 at the Zionist Congress 
in Zurich, Switzerland. At that time, the Jewish Agency was composed of 
both Zionists and non-Zionists, including a strong American 
participation. The Jewish Agency, which was created to aid and support 
distressed Jews and to sustain the Palestine Jewish community, has been 
effectively under Zionist control over the years. It has also served as a
 cover for Shay, which extended its covert operations into Western 
Europe and the United States.

</p><p>From 1923 to 1948, Shay's objectives were to promote the 
establishment of an independent State of Israel; infiltrate Mandatory 
installations in order to apprise Zionist leadership of British 
attitudes and proposed actions; collect political intelligence that 
could be used in Zionist propaganda; penetrate Arab and anti-Zionist 
factions in Palestine and peripheral nations; monitor and control all 
extremist groups — left and right — among Jewish communities in 
Palestine and abroad; provide security for the arms smuggling and 
illegal immigration programs of the Haganah; and finally collect 
information on Nazi Germany to guarantee the security of the Jewish 
underground and escape channels throughout Europe before, during, and 
after World War II.

</p><p>Shay consisted of the following components: Political Intelligence (<i>Machlakit Medinit</i>); Counterespionage and Internal Security (<i>Sherut Bitachon Klali</i>); Military Intelligence (<i>Sherut Modiin</i>); Police Branch of Military Intelligence (<i>Sherut Modiin Shel MateArtzi</i>); and Naval Intelligence and Security (<i>Sherut Modiin ve Betachon Kohoi Ha Yam</i>).
 These services worked independently on behalf of the different 
ministries to which they were individually responsible. This 
intelligence and security community was competitive and frequently acted
 on its own, a product of the general postwar chaos which required the 
accomplishment of many urgent tasks wherever and whenever they might 
arise. In some of the West European capitals all services were 
represented and competed for the same agents and sources.

</p><p>By April 1951, the Prime Minister and cabinet, seriously alarmed 
by the atmosphere of mutual jealousy and mistrust prevalent among the 
services at the increasing cost of their uncoordinated efforts in the 
field, decided to reorganize completely the basic structure of Israel's 
intelligence and security community. The dynamic force behind the plan 
was the late Reuven Shiloah, who reorganized the services according to 
functions and responsibilities and established a mechanism to coordinate
 their activities. Shiloah was chairman of this authority, the Committee
 of the Heads of Services (<i>Va'adat Rashei Hasheruiim</i>, called 
Va'adat). He integrated the Naval Intelligence and Security Service and 
the embryonic air intelligence unit into Military Intelligence (<i>Agaf Modiin</i>).
 The Political Intelligence Service was made independent of the Ministry
 of Foreign Affairs and reorganized as the Secret Intelligence Service (<i>Mossad Letafkidim Meyouchadim</i> or Mossad). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs retained Research Division (<i>Machleket Hackeker</i>).
 Shin Beth remained intact except for internal changes. The Special 
Tasks Division in the Investigation Department of the police became a 
part of the new apparatus. Shiloah's reorganization of the intelligence 
and security structure produced an efficient and well-coordinated 
community.

</p><p>The Israeli intelligence and security services retained this 
structure relatively unchanged throughout the Arab-Israel War in 
October-November 1956, the Six-Day War in June 1967 and the Yom Kippur 
War in Octobeer 1973. During the early and mid-1960s, hovever, the 
Israeli Goverment had considered changes in the structure and duties of 
the components of the intelligence and security community. Despite 
Shiloah's earlier reorganization, much of what happened in the Israeli 
services at this time depended on the personal relationships between Ben
 Gurion and the directors and chiefs. In early 1963, just before his 
retirement, Ben Gurion appointed a committee to review the situation. He
 was concerned that the intelligence and security establishment which by
 virtue of his serving both as Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, 
usually functioned satisfactorily, might deteriorate when he left 
office. He also was reported to be dissatisfied with the lack of clarity
 in the community's chain of command and functions and ordered the 
committee to define the subordination and tasks of these bodies.

</p><p>In July 1963 the committee submitted its report to a new Prime 
Minister, the late Levi Eshkol. The committee stated that, while the 
functions of Prime Minister and Minister of Defense did not necessarily 
have to be concentrated in the hands of one person, the Prime Minister 
must know about all the activities of the national intelligence and 
security services and be given objective intelligence evaluations 
balanced and based on different viewpoints from more than one source. To
 accomplish these aims the committee recommended that the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Research Division be strengthened so that it would be 
capable of presenting independent political evaluations, both on Middle 
East issues and other political subjects. By upgrading the Research 
Division, the committee believed that a certain balance would be created
 for security and political evaluations, which were handled almost 
solely by the Military Intelligence Production Department. The committee
 also observed that the existence of Mossad, which controls secret 
foreign information gathering assets, facilitated to some extent the 
possible formulation of another independent evaluation unit. The 
committee also regarded as a matter of vital importance the appointment 
of a special adviser, subordinate only to the Prime Minister. He would 
be a person of high caliber who would aid the Prime Minister in keeping 
in touch with and monitoring the activities of the intelligence and 
security services. The committee's principal recommendations were not 
implemented at the time except for the extablishment of the adviser 
position and the shift of responsibility for Shin Beth from the Minister
 of Defense to the Prime Minister. There was a brief interlude from 
September 1965 to July 1966 when Isser Harel, the former Chairman of the
 Va'adat and Director of Mossad, served as a special adviser to Prime 
Minister Eshkol on intelligence and security matters. Harel resigned as a
 result of internal policy disputes within the community and he was not 
replaced at the time.

</p><p>Following the alleged "intelligence failure" in the Yom Kippur 
War, the Israeli Governement established the Agranat Commission in 
November 1973 to investigate matters relating to the hostilities and the
 performance of the intelligence and security services. The commission 
in its <i>Partial Report</i> in April 1974 proposed reactivating and 
strengthening the post of special adviser to the Prime Minister on 
intelligence and security matters. The commission also recommended 
changes in the intelligence and security forces through the 
establishement of a reseach and evaluation unit in Mossad and the 
elevation of the Research Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
The object of this modification was to avoid relying exclusively on 
Military Intelligence for major estimates and assessments. The 
commission also emphasized the need for better operational coordination 
in the field of collection between the services but it opposed the 
coordination of their finished intelligence judgments. A&nbsp;full or 
final commission report, if there ever was one, was never made public.

</p><p>From 1974 to 1976 the recommendations of the <i>Partial Report</i>
 of The Agranat Commission were implemented. The Prime Minister 
appointed Reserve General Rehavam Zeevi as his intelligence adviser, a 
postion that was purely advisory and carried no executive authority. 
Zeevi assumed this new job in addition to serving as the Prime 
Minister's adviser on counterterrorism. Zeevi was also to be the Prime 
Minister's liaison with the Director of Military Intelligence and was 
also to keep the Prime Minister alerted to differences of views among 
the intelligence and security services. In October 1976, however, Zeevi 
resigned from this post and was replaced by Brigadier (Ret.) Yehoshafat 
Harkabi, a former Director of Military Intelligence. The Research and 
Political Planning Center of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs came into 
operation in January 1975. Changes in the Military Intelligence 
structure were being carried out. A&nbsp;new research and evaluation 
unit for assessing information was established within Mossad. New 
appointees had taken over in most of the intelligence and security 
components. In June 1977 the Israeli Goverment established a Ministerial
 Committee on Security Affairs.

<a name="3"></a></p><h4>2.&nbsp; Objectives and structure</h4>

<p>The principal targets of the Israeli intelligence and security 
services are: (1) the Arab states — their capabilities and intentions 
toward Israel, their relations with the USSR and other powers, their 
official installations and representatives throughout the world, their 
leaders, internal and inter-Arab politics, morale, military preparedness
 and other order of battle; (2) collection of information on secret US 
policy or decisions, if any, concerning Israel; (3) collection of 
scientific intelligence in the US and other developed countries; (4) 
determination of government policy toward Israel in the USSR and East 
European nations and the problem of Jewish emigration from these areas; 
(5) close monitoring of anti-Zionist activity throughout the world; and 
(6) collection of political, and economic intelligence in other areas of
 interest to them, such as Africa. The Israeli services also make 
special efforts to counter Arab propaganda and to neutralize 
anti-Zionist activity. Within recent years the Israelis have devoted 
much operational activity to combating Arab terrorism, which has grown 
over the years from isolated cross-border raids by Palestinian Fedayeen 
to daring and deadly attacks, often international in scope, on Israeli 
personnel and property. The Israelis also have undertaken widescale 
covert political, economic and paramilitary action programs — 
particularly in Africa.

</p><p>Authorization for foreign intelligence and internal security 
organizations, while not defined by specific charter, is in Israeli 
legislation. Paragraph 29 of the Basic Law states: "The Government is 
authorized to carry out on behalf of the State, in accordance with any 
law any act whose implementation is not lawfully entrusted to any other 
authority." This implies that the goverment is entrusted with the 
management of intelligence and state security affairs since no other 
authority is empowered to act in this sphere by any other law. Attempts 
have been made over the years by officials within the government and the
 community to have an act passed defining the status of foreign 
intelligence and security organizations and their operations, but 
nothing has come of these efforts.

</p><p>Internal security, on the other hand, is more clearly defined in 
law. The Defense (Emergency) Regulations of 1945 (established during the
 British Mandate), the Military Law of 21 June 1955 and the Penal 
Revision (State Security) Law of 31 July 1957, the Israeli equivalent of
 the British Official Secrets Act, all are concerned with internal 
security. The Emergency Regulations of 1945 gave the military 
administration the power to arrest and deport troublesome elements and 
to designate certain locations as "closed areas," thus requiring local 
inhabitants to possess travel permits to transit such places. While the 
regulations originally applied to both Jews and Arabs in Palestine, they
 are now used largely to monitor the Arab community in Israel. 
Administration of the regulations was transferred from the military to 
the police in 1966. Internal security organs reportedly increased their 
agent activity to meet this responsibility.

</p><p>Israeli laws require severe punishment ranging from the death 
penalty or life imprisonment for treason or assistance to the "enemy," 
to terms of incarceration from three to 15 years for espionage, contact 
with foreign agents, aiding and abetting a crime against state security 
and unauthorized disclosure of information by a public servant. There is
 no statute of limitations regarding the unauthoized disclosure of 
classified information.

</p><p>The central body in Israel's intelligence and security community 
is the Va'adat, which has as its primary function the coordination of 
all intelligence and secrurity activities at home and abroad. The 
Va'adat consists of the Director of Mossad, the Director of Military 
Intelligence, the Director of Shin Beth, the Inspector General of 
Police, the Director General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the 
Director of Research and Political Planning Center of the Ministry for 
Foreign Affairs, and the political, military, intelligence and 
antiterrorist advisers of the Prime Minister. The Head of the Special 
Tasks Division in the Investigations Department of the Police also 
occasionally attends the meetings with, or in place of, the Inspector 
General of Police. Meetings must be held biweekly but may be held more 
frequently. At these meetings each director usually provides a briefing 
on the key activitiies of his service during the preceding two weeks. 
The Director of Mossad chairs Va'adat and in this capacity is directly 
responsible to the Prime Minister. The members of Va'adat are 
quasi-equal in status and the term <i>memune</i> referring to the 
Director of Mossad as chairman is designed to denote a concept of 
preeminence among equals. In actuality, however, the Director of 
Military Intelligence now overshadows the Director of Mossad in power 
and importance. This development resulted from the continuing Israeli 
reliance on military preparedness for national survival.

</p><p>Mossad is charged with the collection of foreign intelligence and the conduct of covert action programs outside Israel.

</p><p>Shin Beth is responsible for counterintelligence and internal 
security. It functions as the governmental authority on personnel 
security matters. It is also responsible for the personal safety of the 
Prime Minister and other high ranking Israeli officials. Shin Beth is in
 charge of physical security for ports, airports and key 
military/industrial installations in Israel and for Israeli missions and
 El&nbsp;Al operations outside Israel. Shin Beth does not have the power
 of arrest, this function being performed by the Special Tasks Division 
of the Investigations Department of the Police, which works in close 
collaboration with Shin Beth in Israel. Within the Administered 
Territories, which are controlled by the Israeli Defense Forces, Shin 
Beth applies to the military to undertake arrests and searches. 
A&nbsp;special component under the Inspector General of Police is the 
Border Guard, whose mission is that of guarding the cease-fire lines 
against Arab infiltration and of detecting and running down Fedayeen 
terrorists. In recent years Border guard units have been used 
increasingly to control and suppress riots and demonstrations in the 
West Bank area.

</p><p>Military Intelligence, in additon to its responsibility for 
strategic and tactical intelligence, prepares the national intelligence 
estimates and evaluates all information dealing with the Arabs. It also 
is responsible for developing and protecting communication codes and 
ciphers for all the services and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and 
for communications intelligence.

</p><p>The Research and Political Planning Center, which was formerly 
the Research Division of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, analyzes raw 
intelligence from various sources for officials on the policy making 
level.

</p><p>Other Israeli governement organizations that provide support to 
the intelligence and security community are the Ministries of Finance 
(Customs and Excise, Investment and Securities) and Tourism, the 
national airline, El&nbsp;Al, and the national shipping line, Zim. 
Unofficial Zionist organizations based in Israel and Jewish communities 
throughout the world also give aid to Israeli operations when needed.

</p><p>There are between 1,500 and 2,000 personnel in Mossad, of whom 
about 500 are officers. Shin Beth has about 1,000 members of whom some 
550 hold officer rank. In Military Intelligence there are about 7,000 
personnel, of whom 450 are officers, the others being enlisted personnel
 and civilian clerks. The number of officials in the Research and 
Political Planning Center of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs ranges 
between 75 and 100. The police number about 12,000 and the Border Guards
 around 6,000.

</p><p>Since the financing of the intelligence and security services is a
 closely held secret, it is very difficult to get accurate information 
on the total amounts expended for these purposes. The funds are 
concealed in the defense budget, and known to the Prime Minister, the 
Minister of Defense, one or two of their top assistants, the Minster of 
Finance, the State Comptroller and his Defense Services Inspectorate. 
The Comptroller deals directly with the directors of the services, who 
request funds at the beginning of the fiscal year in April. The 
estimates of expenses by the directors, who have established reputations
 for honesty and integrity are usually acceptable as a starting point 
for budget negotiaions. The Ministry of Finance however, does require a 
10-year projection of expended financial needs (an impossible task which
 is not taken seriously). The Comptroller holds a series of meetings 
with the various service directors and their staffs, reviewing their 
programs in detail. These sessions continue throughout May and result in
 a careful redefinition of the entire intelligence and secrurity effort 
and its cost. By October, the determination of specific budget needs is 
completed, based on the program analysis completed in May. This is then 
submitted for higher approval and the planning and budgeting cycle is, 
upon budget approval, completed just in time to begin again.

</p><p>Much of the administrative support for the services is handled by
 the Ministry for Defense. Various types of cover are provided for and 
funded by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). There is close professional 
cooperation between the civilian intelligence and security services and 
military intelligence. These services, like all goverment offices, are 
subject to inspection by the State Comptroller's office. An Assistant 
Director-General is in charge of inspecting the defense and security 
services, the Ministry for Foreign affairs, and the police. The annual 
inspection covers bookkeeping, financial management and handling of 
administration. The Comptroller is required to see that the services are
 operating economically, efficiently and with irreproachable morality.

</p><p>Israeli governmental offices and departments are continuously 
borrowing money, personnel, equipment and material from one another and 
salaries are paid by the office to which the individual is assigned. An 
intelligence officer or a Ministry for Foreign Affairs official 
stationed in New York and assigned to the Jewish Agency is paid salary 
and allowances by the Agency but loses neither seniority nor retirement 
status while serving in that capacity.

<a name="4"></a></p><h4>3.&nbsp; Political Aspects</h4>

<a name="5"></a><h5>3a.&nbsp; Relationship Between the Government and the Services</h5>

<p>The intellligence and security community enjoys a strong position in 
the government, and their affairs are well integrated into more general 
operations. Members of the generation which worked for the establishment
 of the state were companions of longstanding and joint veterans of such
 enterprises as illegal immigration and arms-running. Many of the 
current leaders came up through the ranks of the military in a series of
 wars with the Arabs and entered politics through affiliation with one 
of the major political parties. All of them had some experience in 
clandestine matters and have been personally convinced by stern lessons 
of the value of good intelligence and security.

</p><p>The intelligence and security services receive excellent support 
from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Many senior diplomats are former 
intelligence officers and therefore conversant with intelligence 
problems and operations. With their experienced observations and 
manifold talents, they serve as valuable auxiliaries to their covert 
colleagues, whose diplomatic cover is diligently sustained by the 
Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Furthermore, almost every Israeli diplomat
 abroad has good foreign language and area knowledge or some 
specialization which enables him to pursue a much broader social life, 
with its resultant contacts, than is the case in most foreign services. 
In many instances, embassy officers, including chiefs of diplomatic 
missions, were former citizens of the countries to which they are 
accredited. Information developed by Israeli diplomats is made available
 to the intelligence and security community for immediate use of 
operational intelligence or inclusion in archives. As a final boon to 
covert intelligence personnel, the vigor and variety of a normal Israeli
 diplomat's life outside his installation usually renders detection of 
intelligence officers by the host country extremely difficult. The same 
kind of effective support regarding operations is given by the Ministry 
of Defense and the Jewish Agency.

</p><p>The Israeli intelligence and security services play an important 
role throughout the government and private sector. Many leaders in both 
the civil service and industry have at some time in their careers been 
directly or indirectly involved with the intelligence community. Service
 assignments are not regarded as the end of a career, as persons with 
intelligence and security backgrounds frequently are selected for other 
jobs in the government. Thus the services are supplemented by persons 
who know and continue to relate their missions to intelligence and 
security responsibilities, in senior posts in both the public and 
private sectors. Officially, the services are nonpolitical and members 
of the community are not encouraged to enroll in any party or engage in 
political activity. The Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee of Knesset
 is normally the government's point of discussion for the review and 
resolution of sensitive policies and activities. The Director of Mossad 
and the Director of Shin Beth are often present at sessions which are of
 concern to them.

<a name="6"></a></p><h5>3b.&nbsp; Relationship Between the Services and the Populace</h5>

<p>The current state of relations between the services and the populace 
is good as a result of the present position of the services as 
protectors of the Israeli state and people in the forefront of the 
struggle against Arab terrorists and military forces. Most Israelis are 
acutely aware of this situation and therefore support the services and 
their operations. The historical development of Israel and the long 
continuing struggle against the Arabs have contributed to this 
harmonious atmosphere.

</p><p>At times in the past as a result of political rivalries and 
disagreements on the kind of order that was to prevail in Israel, there 
have been occasional verbal and journalistic attacks against the 
services as instruments of a police state. In several instances, service
 representatives had to appear in closed court sessions to defend the 
intelligence and security community against accusations of kidnapping, 
brutality and illegality. Although debates in the Knesset occasionally 
have reflected probably illegal practices or procedures by the services,
 the intelligence and security community is completely loyal and if the 
government requested the execution of a certain task, legal and illegal,
 it would be accomplished.

</p><p>Confidence in the intelligence and security community also 
received a boost after the Six-Day War in 1967. The part played by 
Military Intelligence, Shin Beth and the police in contributing to the 
victory and controlling the newly-occupied Arab areas taken by Israel 
was followed by a plethora of praise in all Israeli media. The so-called
 "intelligence failure" in the Yom Kippur War in 1973, however, weakened
 popular trust in the services. The subsequent work of the Agranat 
Commission, undertaken to evaluate the community and its shortcomings 
and to improve cooperation among its members, contributed to a partial 
renewal of public confidence. The continuing battle by the services 
against terorism has also kept Israelis loyal to the community. The 
Entebbe raid in July 1976, which resulted in the rescue of hijacked 
Israeli hostages, was one action in recent years which fired the public 
imagination and served as an example of a well-coordinated and 
well-executed Israeli operation. This raid and its success buoyed up the
 moral of the Israelis as nothing else has in recent years and certainly
 showed the intelligence and security community in a good light.

<a name="7"></a></p><h4>4.&nbsp; Professional Standards</h4>

<a name="8"></a><h5>4a.&nbsp; Integrity</h5>

<p>The directors and senior staff members of the intelligence and 
security community conform to the highest professional standards of 
integrity and honesty and impose these standards on the lower echelons. 
There is relatively little difference between the basic salary of a new 
employee and the staff member who enjoys a top position. The 
insignificant disparity has resulted in the granting of compensatory 
amenities and privileges such as expense accounts, purchasing of foreign
 goods that enter the country through devious tax-free channels, and "<i>protektsia</i>",
 a magic word in Israel, which means that one can get items, housing or 
privileges at low cost through influential governmental connections. 
This is common practice throughout the government establishment, 
however. Because the intelligence and security services, especially Shin
 Beth, maintain a very tight cover within their own community, 
information on personnel, budgets and accounts is closely held by a few 
top people in the government and not subjected to widespread 
bureaucratic perusal and control. The higher echelons scrutinize the 
expenditure of funds by the lower ranks, and if financial dishonesty is 
discovered, the guilty individual receives very severe treatment.

<a name="9"></a></p><h5>4b.&nbsp; Efficiency</h5>

<p>Israel's intelligence and security services are among the best in the
 world. Their expert personnel and sophisticated techniques have made 
them highly effective, and they have demonstrated outstanding ability to
 organize, screen and evaluate information obtained from recruited 
agents, Jewish communities, and other sources throughout the world. 
Israel's intelligence capabilities give it a significant advantage over 
the Arab states — an advantage which was an important factor in the 1967
 war.

</p><p>Those members of the intelligence and security community who were
 identified with the Information Service and other components of the 
Haganah, before and during World War&nbsp;II, developed a high standard 
of efficiency and level of competence. The organizations succeded in 
recruiting a core of capable and highly-educated individuals from Europe
 and the Middle East whose equal has been difficult to find, let alone 
attract, since the founding of the state. The corps of the "old guard," 
for example, is fluent in four or five languages, an accomplishment 
which alone raises their general average of efficiency. The younger 
generation has been given intensive training, including study abroad, to
 assist them in gaining these qualifications. It is not uncommon for 
students to engage in clandestine operations while pursuing their course
 of studies.

</p><p>Israeli signal intelligence successes against the Arabs in the 
past were of such high order that the Israelis had less need than at 
present for good agent operations against the enemy. Part of this 
success was due to poor Arab communications security. The Israelis now 
face some problems since Arab communications security is gradually 
improving. The Yom Kippur War intelligence failure is an example of 
inadequacies in their communications intelligence capability at that 
time. In recent years, as well, there also have been indications that 
Israeli intelligence on the Arabs, other that communications 
intelligence, has been somewhat inadequate in quality and their agent 
operations lacking in success.

</p><p>One of the principal weaknesses of Israeli's intelligence and 
security system appears to be that the production of most finished 
intelligence and the preparation of national estimates is done by 
Military Intelligence rather than by an independent service. Inherent in
 such an organizational arrangement is the danger that the armed 
services will not be objective in observing and reporting foreign 
developments and in making national intelligence estimates — a major 
problem in the Yom Kippur War — and their vested interest in military 
operations will influence intelligence assessments. The Agranat 
Commission has recognized this problem and recommended changes.

<a name="10"></a></p><h5>4c.&nbsp; Security</h5>

<p>The physical security of the civilian and military intelligence and 
security headuarters in Tel Aviv is reported to be excellent. Two 
services — Mossad and Military Intelligence — were formerly located 
within a general army compound in the heart of the city. The buildings 
were protected by high wire fences and military guards. Military 
Intelligence remains in this location but Mossad now occupies a wing of a
 multistory commercial office building across the street from the 
compound. Shin Beth, which was formerly located in a rundown building in
 Jaffa, occupied new quarters just north of Tel Aviv in June 1970. This 
new building, which was designed for their use, is fenced in and 
contains a technical laboratory as well as regular offices. Guards 
control the entrance and badges bearing a photograph of the employee are
 worn within the compound.

</p><p>There is an elaborate protected government "guest house" for the 
training and accommodation of visiting foreign intelligence officers, 
foreign dignitaries and sensitive agents.

</p><p>There are a little over 1,000 persons working as staff officers 
for Mossad and Shin Beth, all of whom have been given a long, thorough 
security check. If there is the slightest doubt raised against an 
individual, the application is rejected. Personnel with leftist 
backgrounds generally are not trusted by leading members of the 
intellligence and security services. This attitude did not always apply 
to former members of European Communist parties, some of whom were 
eminently qualified for clandestine service, especially if they had 
renounced their Communist ideology and affiliated with the Israeli Labor
 Party. This exemption, however, has not applied since the exposure of 
several high-level espionage cases in governmental and political circles
 in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The cases of Aharon Cohen, a MAPAM 
party expert on the Middle East, and Israel Beer (Figure 1), a Defence 
Ministry contract employee and IDF Reserve lieutenant colonel, who spied
 for the USSR, and Dr. Kurt Sitte, a Gentile professor of physics at 
Haifa Technion, who worked for the Czech Service, caused Shin Beth to 
reconsider its own security procedures while stimulating considerable 
doubt about the reliability of recanted Marxists. The services have 
devised internal security systems to expose ideological weaklings by 
more thorough periodic security checks. The Israelis believe such 
individuals constitute a possible long-term security threat. Israeli 
citizens are subjected to stringent registration requirements and must 
carry identification papers. Within the intelligence and security 
community great pains are taken not to reveal the identities of 
personnel even to the average Israeli employed in the government at 
large. Compartmentation is strictly maintained between services with 
only designated individuals, usually members of the "hardcore," crossing
 lines. Intelligence and security personnel widely use and frequently 
change pseudonyms. The national practice of Hebraicizing European or 
Yiddish birth names also makes the identification of some Israelis 
difficult. Visiting foreign officials and agents never use the same car 
twice when meeting clandestinely with Israeli officers within the 
country. Certain unlisted official and personal telephone numbers are 
known only to relatively few people. This type of professional demeanor 
at home provides excellent daily training for intelligence and security 
personnel before receiving foreign assignments.

</p><p>Classified information may not be discussed over the telephone. 
Despite their relatively high standards of security, however, Israeli 
officials reportedly are occasionally careless in observing this 
restriction. They also have "an old boy network" much like the British. 
Israelis in the "network" are willing to discuss classified subjects 
whether or not there is a need to know. The Israelis also have problems 
dealing with overseas Jewry whose support they need but whose security 
is questionable because of the possibility of divided loyalty.

</p><p>Installations and storage containers must conform to rigorous 
security standards. Classification terms Top Secret, Secret, 
Confidential and Restricted (comparable to For Official Use Only) are 
used. Top Secret and Secret documents are transmitted by courier only in
 double envelopes and two receipts are required — one for the package, 
and one for the contents. These documents are logged in and out by date,
 document number, title or subject, and the office accepting 
responsibility for them. At least three periodic inventories are held 
each year. A&nbsp;registry produces a computer printout four times a 
year listing all Top Secret material for which each unit is responsible.
 Electrical communication is handled entirely by teleprinter and other 
communication security devices. A&nbsp;record is made of documents to be
 destroyed and security officers must witness the destruction of all Top
 Secret and Secret material.

</p><p>All personnel requiring a clearance must complete a personal 
history statement and undergo a routine investigation. For higher 
clearances the investigations could include the applicant's entire 
family and a full field investigation. New immigrants from the USSR and 
East European countries are normally denied access to classified 
information for a minimum of four or five years. This ruling is not 
always possible to enforce because of "protektsia." Within the IDF 
security risks are reported to Shin Beth and are closely supervised by 
the unit security officer, who is required to make periodic reports on 
the individual's activities. To stimulate and evaluate the security 
consciousness of the IDF cadre, Field Security personnel circulate among
 the troops and attempt to elicit military information.

<a name="11"></a></p><h5>4d.&nbsp; Morale and Disciplinary Methods</h5>

<p>Mossad and Shin Beth are components of the Israeli civil service 
structure and applicants must pass a civil service examination. Those in
 their twenties with a university degree are preferred, although other 
individuals who have especially desirable qualifications are accepted. 
The intelligence and security services, in direct competion with the 
Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the rapidly expanding business 
community, are at a disadvantage. Most young Israelis do not like the 
anonymity of the secret service and prefer the more remunerative pay 
scales of the business world.

</p><p>Intelligence and security personnel who do not or cannot 
subscribe to the circumscribed life limited by security restrictions and
 operational considerations are either dropped or, if their actions 
should jeopardize the service or the state, are severely punished. To 
boost the morale of staff intelligence officers, the services in the 
early 1960s sought and secured from the Knesset a 30 percent annual 
bonus for their personnel to compensate for the risks and the anonymity 
involved (<a href="http://www.serendipity.li/cia/counterspy/figure_2.jpg">Figure&nbsp;2</a>).

<a name="13"></a><h4>1.&nbsp; Functions</h4>

<p>Mossad is responsible for foreign intelligence collection, political 
action and counterterrorism. In carrying out its mission to collect 
positive intelligence, the principal function of Mossad is to conduct 
agent operations against the Arab nations and their official 
representatives and installations throughout the world, particularly in 
Western Europe and the United States, where the national interests of 
the Arabs in the Near East conflict with Israeli interest. Mossad 
collects information on the disposition, morale, armaments, equipment 
and state of leadership of every Arab Army that could be called into 
action in the case of another round of fighting; and all the information
 that illuminates Arab internal politics and relationships among the 
principal Arab leaders and the diplomatic activity of all countries in 
the Arab world. Mossad monitors Arab commercial activity, particularly 
in the field of arms purchases in the West, and attempts to counteract 
Arab recruiting of military, economic and political experts. In this 
case the principal desire is to recruit these persons as intelligence 
agents, or failing that, either to dissuade them from aiding the Arabs 
or to discover their precise functions. Mossad also is charged with 
inciting disturbances calculated to create mutual distrust among the 
Arabs and to draw Western sympathy away from the Arab cause, and 
monitoring and counteracting Arab propaganda and detecting and 
countering Arab terrorism. In the area of counterterrorism, at times the
 Israelis have carried the fight to Arab terrorists by taking executive 
action against them, especially in parts of the Near East and Western 
Europe. In particular, the fact that Lebanon has a mixed Christian, 
Druze and Moslem populationn has made that country attractive for 
intelligence projects. The Israelis have covert assets and run 
operations in their northern neighbor. In the past they have mounted 
paramilitary and executive action operations against Palestinian 
terrorist leaders, personnel and installations in Lebanon. They have 
also provided support to Christian rightists in the Lebanese civil war.

</p><p>In addition to running operations against the Arabs, Mossad 
collects political, economic and scientific intelligence in both the 
Eastern and Western worlds for the protection of the State of Israel, 
Zionism and Jews generally. Their collection efforts are especially 
concentrated in the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as at 
the United Nations, where policy decisions could have repercussions on 
Israel and Zionist goals.

</p><p>Objectives in Western countries are equally important to the 
Israeli intelligence service. Mossad collects intelligence regarding 
Western, Vatican, and UN policies toward the Near East, promotes arms 
deals for the benefit of the IDF, and acquires data for use in silencing
 anti-Israel factions in the West.

<a name="14"></a></p><h4>2.&nbsp; Organization</h4>

<p>Mossad has eight departments: (1) Operational Planning and 
Coordination; (2) Collection; (3) Political Action and Liaison; (4) 
Manpower, Finance, Logistics and Security; (5) Training; (6) Research; 
(7) Technical Operations; and (8) Technology (<a href="http://www.serendipity.li/cia/counterspy/figure_3.jpg">Figure&nbsp;3</a>).

</p><p>The Operational Planning and Coordination Department is concerned
 with the management of Mossad resources and responsible for 
interdirectorate operational and administrative coordination within the 
organization and interservice liaison within the Israeli intelligence 
and security community. This department also deals with requirements and
 the development of overall collection plans.

</p><p>The Collection Department is responsible for foreign covert 
operations and the processing and production of reporting from 
clandestine sources. This component is the largest unit in Mossad. The 
department has offices abroad under Israeli diplomatic and nonofficial 
cover and is active mainly in Europe, where it concentrates on Arab 
targets through third-country operations.

</p><p>The Political Action and Liaison Directorate is in charge of 
political action and relations with friendly foreign services. This 
component also maintains contact with those nations and political groups
 with whom Israel does not have normal diplomatic relations (that is, 
African countries, Lebanon and/or Lebanese Christian rightist factions 
and Indonesia).

</p><p>There is also a Psychological Warfare or Special Operations 
Division, probably in the Political Action and Liasion Directorate, 
which runs highly sensitive covert action operations against Arab 
terrorists and ex-Nazis, and sabotage, paramilitary and psychological 
warfare projects, such as character assassination and black propaganda.

</p><p>In the absence of the Director of Mossad, the Director of the 
Operational Planning and Coordination Department now becomes acting 
Director, whereas in past years the Director of the Collection 
Department acted for the Director of Mossad. With the drive for greater 
and improved coordination within the intelligence and security 
community, the Director of the Operational Planning and Coordination 
Department has apparently taken precedence over the Director of the 
Collection Department.

</p><p>In headquarters, the department directors direct the various 
area, functional, administrative, and financial controllers. The area 
departments under the control of the Collection and Special Political 
Action and Liaison Departments are: (1) Central America, (2) South 
America, (3) Eastern Europe including the USSR, (4) Africa, (5) Asia and
 Oceania, (6) the Mediterranean and Near East areas, (7) Europe, and (8)
 North America. Under each controller there are branches or desks which 
are responsible for one or more countries.

</p><p>Positive intelligence and counterintelligence reports are sent 
back to Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv, evaluated by the Research 
Department, and disseminated to various government offices. Intelligence
 reports on the Arabs are forwarded by Mossad to the Research Department
 of the DMI while counterespionage reports are sent through Mossad to 
Shin Beth, where they are given special processing by 
counterintelligence investigative departments.

</p><p>Mossad controls Israeli foreign intelligence activities except 
for operations launched from Israel against military objectives in 
peripheral areas of surrounding Arab countries, which are under the 
jurisdiction of DMI. Mossad operations abroad fall into two principal 
categories: those in the Near East, as a first line of defense, and 
those elsewhere. The Israelis have designated Egypt as the main target 
area for establishing intelligence networks. In 1970 the Israelis 
estimated that about 50 percent of their operational effort was directed
 against Egypt. The next priority is Syria. Much of this activity 
against the Arabs in the Near East is based on deep cover operations by 
Israeli illegals or the recruitment of Arabs in third countries followed
 by their dispatch or normal rotation back home to an Arab area. Two 
good examples of Israeli deep cover illegal operations are the Cohen and
 Lotz cases.

</p><p>Elishu Ben Shaul Cohen was an Egyptian-born Jew who was involved 
in Israeli sabotage operations against American and British 
installations in Egypt in 1952. Cohen succeeded in escaping detection, 
when most members of the ring were arrested by the Egyptians, and went 
to Israel. Eventually, Mossad recruited Cohen for an illegal operation 
designed to develop intelligence networks and acquire political and 
military information in Syria. He received intensive training, adopted 
the identity of the late Kamil Amin Thabet, a Syrian-born merchant, and 
emigrated to Argentina, where he became an active member of the Arab 
emigre community. Cohen eventually went to Syria, where he was assisted 
by two Arabs who had previously been recruited by the Israelis. From 
1961 until 1965 Cohen was active as an illegal in Damascus, where he 
succeeded in making numerous contacts with political and military 
personalities in the Syrian establishment. He made occasional trips to 
Europe and Israel for extensive debriefings. Eventually, in January 
1965, the Syrians did detect and locate Cohen while he was in the act of
 transmitting information to Tel Aviv. One cause of his downfall was 
that he was using hand morse radio equipment and had been on the air for
 an hour when he was caught (Figure 4). A&nbsp;Syrian court tried Cohen 
and found him guilty of espionage. He was publicly hanged in Damascus in
 May 1965.

</p><p>Johann Wolfgang Lotz (also known as Zeev Gur Arieh), was an 
officer in Military Intelligence. In 1959 during a Va'adat meeting, 
Mossad announced its need for a man to be a new illegal resident agent 
in Cairo under cover as a former Nazi officer. Lotz accepted the 
assignment, which was directed primarily against special weapons 
activity by German scientists in Egypt. He received intensive training 
in Israel, went to Germany and surfaced as an East German refugee and 
former African Corps officer. Although Lotz had a wife in Israel, he 
eventually married a German woman to develop his legend. In 1961 he went
 to Cairo, where he opened a riding academy. Through his activities Lotz
 made a variety of contacts in the German community in the Egyptian 
capital and in time made the acquaintance of a number of prominent and 
well-placed Egyptians. He made a number of trips from Egypt to Western 
Europe for debriefings. Finally, in 1964 Lotz began to mail threatening 
letters to selected German experts in Egypt. In February 1965, he was 
arrested by the Egyptians, who tried and imprisoned him. Eventually he 
was released and returned to Israel in 1968. The Israelis have stated 
that the operation cost them about $250,000. They have also admitted 
that errors by Lotz in handling his communications and his use in 
executive action operations may have led to his downfall. During his 
captivity Lotz was also forced to reveal the whole operation (Figure 5).

</p><p>Mossad stations outside of the Arab areas in the Near East are 
generally under diplomatic cover within the embassies and consulates of 
Israel. There are stations in the United States, most of the European 
capitals, Turkey, Iran and strategic centers in Latin America, Africa 
and the Far East. Operations range from formal liaison exchanges with 
host services through unilateral projects to special executive actions 
directed against Arab terrorists. There are also smaller stations, which
 run mostly unilateral operations and handle local liaison on such 
matters as Arab terrorists.

</p><p>The Collection Directorate and the Political Action and Liaison 
Directorate are separate components of Mossad and are carefully 
compartmented at headquarters. Collection and Political Action and 
Liaison maintain separate permanent staffs outside Israel in larger 
stations. There are thus either two Mossad stations or two compartmented
 components in each station in some countries — one for unilateral 
clandestine collection and one for liaison. For example, at present in 
Paris the Israelis have an Embassy, Consulate-General and Ministry of 
Defense Mission. Under embassy cover, Mossad has a Collection 
Directorate regional controller and a Political Action and Liaison 
Directorate regional controller in the French capital, which has more or
 less over the years remained the fulcrum of Israeli intelligence 
activity on the continent of Europe.

</p><p>In Switzerland the Israelis have an Embassy in Bern and a 
Consulate-General in Zurich which provide cover for Collection 
Department officers involved in unilateral operations. These Israeli 
diplomatic installations also maintain close relations with the Swiss on
 a local level in regard to overt functions such as physical security 
for Israeli official and commercial installations in the country and the
 protection of staff members and visiting Israelis. There is also close 
collaboration between the Israelis and Swiss on scientific and technical
 matters pertaining to intelligence and security operations. Swiss 
officials have made frequent trips to Israel. There is a continual flow 
of Israelis to and through Switzerland. These visits, however, are 
usually arranged through the Political Action and Liaison regional 
controller at the Embassy in Paris directly with the Swiss and not 
through the officials in the Israeli Embassy in Bern, although the 
latter are kept informed.

</p><p>In Spain, on the other hand, there is no known offical or 
semiofficial Israeli installation. There have been contacts, however 
between Political Action and Liaison Directorate officials of Mossad and
 the Spanish service for some time. The original meeting apparently 
occured in Paris in the late 1960s, since then there have been contacts 
in Madrid and Paris. There is a possiblity that Mossad may also have a 
clandestine Collection Department station in Spain. In January 1973, 
Baruch Asher Cohen, a Mossad officer, was assassinated in Madrid by 
Arabs.

</p><p>Special operations are mounted on an ad hoc basis. Headquarters 
directs the effort from Israel and employs Mossad officers and agents on
 special temporary duty. In July 1973, an Israeli assassination squad of
 16 was involved in the murder of a Moroccan Arab in Lillehammer, 
Norway. Norwegian authorities captured, tried and imprisoned six of the 
group, the rest escaped. It became clear in the course of the trial that
 the squad, which was composed of Israelis, who were Mossad officers, 
and European Jews, who were recruited for the mission, did much of its 
preparatory work in Paris and entered Norway on a specific assignment — 
the elimination of Arab terrorists. After the murder, two of the squad 
sought refuge with an Israeli Embassy security officer. The Norwegians 
declared the officer personna non grata [sic], although he apparently 
was not privy to the operation.

<a name="15"></a></p><h4>3.&nbsp; Administrative practices</h4>

<p>The Israeli Prime Minister appoints the Director of Mossad. The Prime
 Minister does not need the approval of the cabinet or the Knesset for 
this appointment.

</p><p>Chiefs of station and their staffs are Mossad career officers but
 they function abroad on behalf of all the intelligence and security 
services. If a member of Shin Beth or the IDF is considered the most 
qualified individual in the community to do a particular foreign job, he
 still belongs to his parent organization, but he is assigned to, and 
subject to the control of Mossad as long as he remains outside the 
borders of Israel. This rule does not apply, however, to military 
attaches (army, air, navy) who remain subordinate to the Director of 
Military Intelligence.

</p><p>Mossad does not have a logical career progression program. The 
organization promotes case officers who have been succcessful in the 
field to top managerial jobs. The results of this arrangement are mixed 
as some of the successful operators are often not necessarily the best 
managers or administrators.

<a name="16"></a></p><h5>3a.&nbsp; Training</h5>

<p>The Mossad training cycle encompasses a Basic Operations course for 
recruits and lower ranking personnel, and [sic] Operations course and a 
Field Operations course. All new officer candidates are required to take
 the four-month Basic Operations course before actually entering on 
duty. The entire training cycle takes almost two years and is generally 
given to classes of 12. Most of the training takes place in the Tel Aviv
 area. The instructors in these Mossad courses are teachers on permanent
 assignment, intelligence officers on temporary tours of duty, and 
headquarters personnel, including the Director of Mossad and department 
directors, who give occasional lectures on their specialties.

</p><p>The three services run a joint advanced school in Jersalem that 
offers specialized courses of two to three months' duration on world 
political affairs, Israel's political and economic objectives, new 
technical operational aids, and the latest information on foreign 
intelligence services. All officers who are midway in their careers are 
required to attend this advanced school upon their return from a foreign
 assignment. As many as 40 to 50 students are reported to have been 
enrolled in a single running of this course. The faculty is composed of 
representatives of the three services and is directly subordinate to the
 Director of Mossad. The Prime Minister or some other high official has 
addressed graduating classes.

</p><p>Some younger Mossad officers, who may be weak in certain fields 
of higher education or languages, are sent to universities abroad, where
 their pursuit of an advanced degree simultaneously serves as cover for 
their extracurricular operational activities. One of the established 
goals of the intelligence and security services is that each officer be 
fluent in Arabic. A&nbsp;nine-month, intensive Arabic language course is
 given annually in the Tel Aviv area to students from each service. The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs also sends two or three officials to each 
course. Mossad officers who are going into Arab operations take the same
 Arabic language training as Shin Beth officers. As further training, 
these Mossad officers work in the Administered Territories for two years
 to sharpen their language skills before being posted abroad. During 
this period they usually serve in the Sinai and often run Bedouin agents
 into Egypt in conjunction with Military Intelligence.

</p><p>All Mossad officers are trained in the use of small arms and required to fire them at regular intervals.

<a name="17"></a></p><h5>3b.&nbsp; Funds and Salaries</h5>

<p>The Director of Mossad is a civil service Class 1 officer. He 
receives generous expense and entertainment allowances. There are 
reported to be several Class 2 and Class 3 officers in Mossad as well. 
The monthly take home pay of a ranking Mossad officer, after taxes but 
including bonuses and cost-of-living and family allowances, is about 
[unclear: 'IL4,000'?] per month (US$460). They also receive expense and 
entertainment allowances and are provided with a car and gasoline 
allowance as well. Higher academic degrees place intelligence officers 
in a higher pay bracket, thus a directorate director with an advanced 
degree makes the same as the Director. A&nbsp;middle-ranking officer 
with allowances for a large number of dependents would receive more than
 his seniors. In general, higher-grade civil service salaries are 
roughly comparable to those of higher-ranking military officers. The 
rather insignificant differential between grades is compensated by 
fairly impressive perquisites, especially in the senior ranks. Officers 
abroad are given generous cost-of-living allowances that conform to the 
allotments of the regular Foreign Affairs officers. For cover purposes 
these are paid by the Foreign Affairs Ministry. If, however, an 
intelligence officer needs a larger apartment or house for 
representation, operational purposes, or family requirements, his 
service quietly pays the difference.

</p><p>Officers and their families usually travel tourist class on 
Israeli carriers whenever possible but the absence of a firm rule 
permits them to travel on any air or steamship line at their discretion.
 Clerical employees travel tourist class.

</p><p>Each station abroad is granted funds for operational and 
entertainment expenses. Responsible individuals do not entertain any 
more than is necessary but when they do, it is done lavishly. Efforts to
 extend hospitality unstintingly are made at headquarters in Israel when
 favored agents or ranking foreign intellligence officers are guests.

<a name="18"></a></p><h4>4.&nbsp; Methods of Operation</h4>

<p>Mossad over the years has enjoyed some rapport with highly-placed 
persons and government offices in every country of importance to Israel.
 Within Jewish communities in almost every country of the world, there 
are Zionists and other sympathizers, who render strong support to the 
Israeli intelligence effort. Surch contacts are carefully nurtured and 
serve as channels for information, deception material, propaganda and 
other purposes. Mossad directs clandestine operations throughout Europe,
 including the USSR and East European countries; North and South 
America; the Near East; Africa; and the Far East, including South East 
Asia. Mossad activities are generally conducted through Israeli official
 and semiofficial establishments, deep cover enterprises in the form of 
firms and organizations, some especially created for, or adaptable to, a
 specific objective, and penetrations effected within non-Zionist 
national and international Jewish organizations.

</p><p>The function of intelligence officers under cover of diplomatic 
establishments is to arrange information exchanges with officials of 
local services, manage communications, serve as accommodation addresses 
and funding channels, and direct agents toward targets of interest. 
Official organizations used for cover are Israeli Purchasing Missions 
and Israeli Government Tourist, El&nbsp;Al and Zim offices, Israeli 
constrution firms, industrial groups and international trade 
organizations also provide nonofficial cover. Individuals working under 
deep or illegal cover are normally charged with penetrating objectives 
that require a long-range, more subtle approach, or with activities in 
which the Israeli Government can never admit complicity.

</p><p>Many Israelis have come from Arab countries where they were born 
and educated and appear more Arab than Israeli in speech, demeanor, and 
attitude. By forging passports and identity documents of Arab and 
western countries and providing sound background legends and cover, 
Mossad has successfully sent into Egypt and other Arab countries 
Israelis disguised and documented as Arabs or citizens of European 
countries.

</p><p>There are numerous persons in Israel who have a thorough area and
 language knowledge of any area of interest to the intelligence 
services. These area experts can render extremely valuable assistance in
 analyzing intelligence information and formulating country 
requirements, thus contributing to the total operational potential since
 they enable Israeli intelligence officers to estimate rapidly the 
efficiency and reliability of their agents and informants. These persons
 are also useful for their ability to pass completely for a citizen of 
the nation in question. The Israeli talent for counterfeiting or forging
 passports and documents ably supports the agent's authenticity.

</p><p>The Israeli intelligence service depends heavily on the various 
Jewish communities and organizations abroad for recruiting agents and 
eliciting general information. The aggressively ideological nature of 
Zionism, which emphasizes that all Jews belong to Israel and must return
 to Israel, had had its drawbacks in enlisting support for intelligence 
operations, however, since there is considerable opposition to Zionism 
among Jews througout the world. Aware of this fact, Israeli intelligence
 representatives usually operate discreetly within Jewish communities 
and are under instructions to handle their missions with utmost tact to 
avoid embarrassment to Israel. They also attempt to penetrate 
anti-Zionist elements in order to neutralize the opposition. Despite 
such precautions, the Israelis frequently experience setbacks and there 
have been several cases where attempted recruitments of Americans of the
 Jewish faith have been rejected and reported to US authorities.

</p><p>Israel's program for accelerating its technological, scientfic 
and military development as rapidly as possible has been enhanced by 
exploiting scientific exchange programs. Mossad plays a key role in this
 endeavor. In addition to the large-scale acquisition of published 
scientific papers and technical journals from all over the world through
 overt channels, the Israelis devote a considerable portion of their 
covert operations to obtaining scientific and technical intelligence. 
This had included attempts to penetrate certain classified defense 
projects in the United States and othe Western nations.

</p><p>The United Nations is a major target for Mossad penetration 
because it is a major sponsor of international exchanges in all fields 
and because of its importance in settling disputes between Israel and 
the Arab states. Israeli agents operate at the UN under diplomatic and 
journalistic cover.

</p><p>Mossad recruitment, training and control of agents varies widely,
 depending upon the target area of operation and the desk in 
headquarters. While there is a certain amount of standardization in the 
handling of operations, Israeli intelligence officers appear to have 
considerable freedom in running operations. There is no hard rule 
requiring specific headquarters approval prior to the recruitment of an 
agent except in the case of Communist countries. Name traces are 
requested of headquarter's voluminous files but this is not a consistent
 routine. Contemplated operations against the USSR and the East European
 countries, however, are approached very cautiously, and entail a great 
deal of headquarters planning and control and a special branch composed 
of area experts is responsible for authorizing and directing this 
activity. Mossad is especially interested in early warning regarding 
such developments as the dispatch of Soviet military units from the USSR
 to the Near East. There also exists within, or affiliated with, Mossad a
 small unit whose sole objective is to remind the Soviets through 
propaganda and contacts about the Jewish question at any point throuout 
the world. All sorts of people, even Cyrus Eaton, have been stimulated 
to raise the subject. Israeli efforts must at times be effective because
 the Soviets often attack the Israeli service in their propaganda with 
detailed revelations of Israeli plots against allegedly innocent Soviet 
citizens.

</p><p>The Israelis select their agents almost exclusively from persons 
of Jewish origin. However, there are security hazards involved in cases 
of divided allegiance between dedication to the Zionist State of Israel 
and loyalty to a homeland. The recruitment of Gentiles is comparatively 
rare.

</p><p>Many Arabs, especially walk-ins, have directly or indirectly 
helped the services, usually as a result of monetary inducements, but 
the Israelis do not consider these Arabs good sources of reliable 
information. More often, they recruit Palestinians over whom they may 
have more control because of bank assets frozen in Israel since the war 
in 1948. In certain cases these bank assets have been released for 
intelligence services rendered.

</p><p>The Israelis are prepared to capitalize on nearly every kind of 
agent motivation. A&nbsp;substantial effort is made to appeal to Jewish 
racial or religious proclivities, pro-Zionism, dislike of anti-Semitism,
 anti-Soviet feelings (if applicable) and humanitarian instincts. 
Blackmail is also used. Other recruiting techniques include the proffer 
of money, business opportunities, or release from prison. Among the 
Arabs, money has been especially effective. Appeals have also been made 
successfully to other Arab vulnerabilities such as jealousy, rivalry, 
fear and political dissension.

</p><p>The Israelis have used false-flag recruitment pitches extensively
 and successfully. In several cases they approached citizens of Western 
European nations under the cover of a national NATO intellegence 
organization for operations in Arab target countries.

</p><p>While intelligence officers in the field recognize the importance
 of security, they tend to be careless. Although otherwise well trained,
 Israeli intelligence officers occasionally have been lax in their use 
of the telephone abroad. Also, they often have given away a considerable
 amount of information by confiding in agents and contacts with whom 
they have had only a slight relationship. Nonetheless, they periodically
 recall the basic principles of their profession, and for awhile 
complicate the lives of their agents with a welter of security 
regulations that they themselves eventually transgress. Occasionally a 
rendezvous arranged between an officer and an agent is countersurveilled
 by two or more officers, both to spot possible surveillance of the 
meeting and to protect the officer. In the recruiting process, the 
officer generally uses a fictitious name, executes a secrecy agreement 
with the prospective agent, and provides him with a pseudonym or alias. 
Whenever money or other gratuity is given to an agent, an attempt is 
made to secure a signed receipt in the agent's handwriting.

</p><p>Although an agent occasionally may be sent to Israel for special 
training, this course of action is neither easy nor inexpensive to 
accomplish. Therefore, the intelligence officer himself is usually 
responsible for training the agent in the fundamentals of tradecraft, 
security measures, and the use of radio and code communications. If the 
exigencies of the situation demand special training, the Israelis rent 
an apartment for this purpose in places like Paris and New York. Agents 
who have been so trained were taught to mix and use secret ink, conceal 
documents and letters on the person, deliver information to secure 
hiding places, and to communicate ortherwise with the case officer 
and/or headquarters.

</p><p>The methods of communication vary greatly depending on locations 
and circumstances. Personal meetings between the agent and his case 
officer are arranged by secret writing, open mail, or oral message by 
couriers. The cities or towns to be used have code names and the meeting
 places are at specified times with alternative times and places. In 
case of emergency, the agent can alert the intelligence officer by use 
of a prearranged open code in cables or letters, or if time permits, by 
secret writing or courier.

</p><p>The Israelis place considerable emphasis on personal 
relationships with their agents. They have been known to be exceedingly 
generous in granting personal concessions and monetary assistance to 
keep their agents happy. One such individual, a journalist in Paris who 
recruited French officials and elicited information from witting and 
unwitting informants in the French political world, was paid the 
equivalent of US$1,000 per month. After years of steady employment and a
 succession of Israeli case officers, his services were gently but 
peremptorily terminated. Severance pay was calculated at the rate of one
 month's salary for each year of service to assuage any hard feelings. 
On the other hand, the Israelis can be absolutely ruthlesss to both the 
intelligence officer and the agent if the latter's disaffection or 
treachery should threaten a sensitive operation or endanger the security
 of the state. There are several cases of Jews in Europe who, while or 
after working for the Israeli service, trafficked with the Egyptians for
 substantial sums of money. These Jews were enticed into traveling to 
Israel or abducted, tried in camera, and given stiff prison terms of 10 
to 14 years.

</p><p>Mossad headquarters controls the acquisition, flow and 
dissemination of reports in a rigid manner, which contrasts with the 
considerable freedom allowed in running operations. An Israeli 
intelligence officer abroad must accept all information reported by an 
agent and may not change a single word. The intelligence officer 
receives detailed, prepared questions from headquarters and is allowed 
little leeway in terms of what he submits. In a meeting with an agent, 
many of whom are low-level, the intelligence officer debriefs him on the
 basis of headquarters questions. The intelligence officer must then 
forward all the agent says, even overt information. The intelligence 
officer may if he wishes add his own remarks to the report.

</p><p>Mossad headquarters does not disseminate agents reports to all 
customer agencies. The overwhelming bulk of the reports goes to one 
specific analytical unit, for example, usually reports on Arab affairs 
are sent to Military Intelligence, counterintelligence reports to Shin 
Beth. However, an exceptional agent report is disseminated to Israeli 
policymakers. The Mossad intelligence officer abroad does not show 
copies of his reports to the Israeli Ambassador but sends them only to 
Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv.

</p><p>The Israeli services have a very keen interest in the use and 
development of technical equipment. As far back as 1947-1948, the 
Information Service conducted technical surveillance operations against 
Arab and British delegates to the&nbsp;UN. Mossad with assistance from 
Shin Beth has provided technical training to the Turkish and Ghanian 
security and intelligence services. Exchanges of technical equipment and
 information have also been carried out with the Japanese intelligence 
and security services. Mossad receives support in external technical 
operations from Shin Beth and Military Intelligence. The technical 
capabilities of the Israeli services are adequate for normal demands. 
Moreover, the very close coordination existing between the services and 
the industrial concerns of the country ensure that technical equipment 
to support continuing audio operations is supplied and developed as 
needed. The existence of a limited research program, coupled with high 
Israeli competence in technical matters, indicates that the Israelis 
intend to remain abreast of advances in audiosurveillance and 
countermeasures.

<a name="19"></a></p><h5>4a.&nbsp; Relationship with Other Services</h5>

<p>Mossad has good relationships with Shin Beth, Military Intelligence, 
the Research and Political Planning Center of the Ministry for Foreign 
Affairs, and the Special Tasks Division of the police. Successes like 
the Entebbe raid are illustrative of well-coordinatated planning and 
execution — a testimonial to good relations among the services.

</p><p>The Agranat Commission advocated greater coordination between the
 services and revived the post of intelligence adviser to monitor 
interdirectorate disuputes. The exchanges between Mossad and the other 
services through the coordinating mechanism of the Va'adat and the use 
of ad hoc committees, however, continue to ensure coordination and 
cooperation between the services.

<a name="20"></a></p><h5>4b.&nbsp; Liaison with Foreign Services</h5>

<p>Mossad has liaison relationships with many of intelligence and 
security services throughout the world. With a few exceptions, the 
Directorate of Foreign Liaison and Politcal Action is responsible for 
relations with most foreign organizations. In most instances the point 
of contact is abroad in foreign capitals, although some foreign services
 insist on liaison in Israel.

</p><p>At present Mossad, in coordination with Shin Beth, maintains 
liaison with foreign intelligence and security services through 
membersihp in the Kilowatt group, an organization which is concerned 
with Arab terrorism, and is comprised of West Germany, Belgium, Italy, 
the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, 
France, Canada, Ireland, Sweden, Norway and Israel. The Israelis also 
have informal connections regarding terrorism with other European 
nations, including Spain, Portugal and Austria.

</p><p>The Israelis have over the years made efforts to break the Arab 
ring encircling Israel by involvement with non-Arab Moslem nations in 
the Near East. A&nbsp;formal trilateral liaison called the Trident 
organization was established by Mosssad with Turkey's National Security 
Service (TNSS) and Iran's National Organization for Intelligence and 
Security (SAVAK) in late 1958. Since the original agreement there has 
been an addition to Mossad's bilateral relationship with each service. 
The Trident organization involves continuing intelligence exchange plus 
semiannual meetings at the chief of service level.

</p><p>The general terms of the original agreement with the Turks, aside
 from legitimizing Israeli liaison with Turkey, stated that Mossad would
 furnish information on the activity of Soviet agents in Turkey and 
those working against Turkey thoughout the Middle East. In return, the 
Turks agreed to supply Israel with information on the political 
intentions of the Arab countries which could affect the security of 
Israel, and the activity and identification of UAR agents working 
against Israel. The Israeli service has also given the Turks 
counterespionage and technical training.

</p><p>The main purpose of the Israeli relationship with Iran was the 
development of a pro-Israel and anti-Arab policy on the part of Iranian 
officials. Mossad has engaged in joint operations with SAVAK over the 
years since the late 1950s. Mossad aided SAVAK activities and supported 
the Kurds in Iraq. The Israelis also regularly transmitted to the 
Iranians intelligence reports on Egypt's activities in the Arab 
countries, trends and developments in Iraq, and Communist activities 
affecting Iran.

</p><p>Israeli liaison in Africa has varied considerably from country to
 country, depending on the exigencies of the situration. Israeli 
intelligence activities in Africa have usually been carried out under 
the cover of military and police training, arms sales to national 
military forces, and aid and development programs. The Arab nations, in 
conjunction with the Organization of African Unity, have brought great 
pressure to bear on most African nations to break all formal ties with 
Israel. Despite the break in diplomatic relations between Israel and 
many of the African nations, the Israelis still maintain good 
intelligence liaison with certain African services. The Israelis also 
have relations with the Kenyan Service. In Central Africa the Israelis 
are still active in Zaire. In West Africa the Israelis trained the 
Liberian Security Service and police. They also helped establish the 
Ghanian Military Intelligence Service. In southern Africa the Israelis 
have a relationship with the South African Intelligence and security 
services.

</p><p>The Israelis have been very active in Latin America over the 
years. One of the greatest intelligence coups, the capture of Adolph 
Eichmann, the former Nazi leader, occurred in Argentina. Recently, much 
of their liaison activity in Latin America has centered on training and 
antiterrorist operations. The Israeli Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, for 
example, provides cover for a Mossad regional station responsible for 
Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. Officers from this post have gone
 to Buenos Aires to give training to the Argentines. In the course of 
these contacts the Israelis recommended greater involvement in joint 
antiterrorist operations. The Israelis also maintain liaison with 
security services of Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, the 
Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Caracas is 
the Regional Center for north and western Latin America and Central 
America.

</p><p>The Israelis have operated for sometime in East Asia. They have 
provided intelligence training to the Government of the Republic of 
China and maintain liaison with it. The Israelis also have relations 
with the Japanese, Thai, Indonesian, and South Korean services, 
especially on terrorist matters. The major Mossad regional center in 
East Asia is in Singapore. The Israeli station chief there frequently 
travels thoughout the neighboring nations. Indonesia as a Moslem nation 
does not have formal diplomatic ties with Israel. The Mossad-Indonesian 
relationship, therefore, is very discreet. The Mossad representative in 
Singapore is accredited to the Indonesian service. There are also Mossad
 officers in Jakarta under commercial cover. The primary reason for the 
Indonesian liaison is to gain aid in counterterrorist efforts. The 
Isaelis, on the other hand, are not only engaging in antiterrorist 
operations but also have an opportunity to collect information and 
engage in political action in another Moslem power.

<a name="22"></a><h4>1.&nbsp; Functions</h4>

<p>Shin Beth has the responsibility in Israel for counterespionage and 
internal security and the service is basically internally oriented. Shin
 Beth is primarily responsible for collecting information on foreign 
intelligence organizations, both hostile and friendly, and their 
activities; protecting the security of Israeli officials and 
installations abroad, and investigating all forms of subversion directed
 by either internal or external forces, including sabotage and terrorism
 in Israel and abroad. Shin Beth evaluates all information developed, 
collates it with other material routinely and overtly available from 
both Israeli and foreign sources, and submits evaluated reports to the 
appropriate government agencies for action. Shin Beth operates to combat
 two main adversaries: the Arabs and the Soviet and Eastern European 
intelligence and security services.

</p><p>Shin Beth at one time engaged in positive intelligence operations
 and immigration affairs in the Balkan countries, particularly in 
Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and in Hungary, but no longer does. Shin 
Beth is the government's authority on personnel and physical security 
matters, is responsible for the personal security of the President, the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense.

</p><p>Shin Beth does not have the power of arrest, which is the right 
only of the Special Tasks Division of the Investigations Department of 
the Israeli Police, a national force with headquarters in Jerusalem. 
When an arrest is desired, Shin Beth submits a detailed report on the 
case plus a request for an arrest warrant to the Ministry of Justice. 
The Legal Department transmits the request to the Special Tasks 
Division, which issues the warrant and makes the arrest. When more 
expeditious handling is justified, Shin Beth directly notifies the 
Special Tasks Division, which is empowered to take the suspect into 
temporary custody pending receipt of the warrant. On occasion a Shin 
Beth officer will sit in court with the prosecution staff as a special 
consultant.

<a name="23"></a></p><h4>2.&nbsp; Organization</h4>

<p>Shinn Beth is organized into eight operational and functional 
departments. (1) Arab Affairs; (2) Non-Arab Affairs; (3) Protective 
Security; (4) Operational Support; (5) Technology; (6) Interrogation and
 Legal Counsel; (7) Coordination and Planning; and (8) Administration. 
Regional departments in the field are located in the Gaza/Sinai area 
with headquarters in Ashqelon; the Northern area with headquarters in 
Haifa; and the West Bank area with headquarters in Jerusalem. 
A&nbsp;unit within Shin Beth national headquarters in Tel Aviv serves as
 the fourth regional department. These regional departments are broken 
down into subdivisions identical to but smaller than those of the parent
 organization (<a href="http://www.serendipity.li/cia/counterspy/figure_6.jpg">Figure&nbsp;6</a>).

</p><p>The Arab Affairs Department is responsible for counterespionage, 
antiterrorist operations, control of political subversion, research and 
the maintenance of a counterintelligence index on Arabs. The components 
handling these activities are organized into offensive and defensive 
sections. This department operates through field offices controlled by 
regional officers. These officers report to the regional commanders but 
rely on the Arab Affairs Department for guidance and support, which 
includes aid in counterespionage, countersabotage and surveillance as 
well as research and records support. The overall headquarters function 
is that of determining doctrine, systematizing work and supervising.

</p><p>The Non-Arab Department handles counterintelligence operations 
dealing with all other countries, countersubversion (one component 
dealing with Communist subversion, the other with non-Communist New Left
 subversion), foreign liaison and research. Each unit dealing with these
 activities has offensive and defensive sections. The Non-Arab 
Department investigates and counters espionage activity by foreign 
powers, both hostile and friendly, by all known methods, including the 
penetration of their intelligence services and diplomatic installations 
in Israel. Operations against foreign missions within Israel were 
formerly conducted by Military Intelligence, but with the evolution 
towards greater centralization and professional specialization since the
 reorganization of 1951, this function has been the responsibility of 
Shin Beth.

</p><p>The Non-Arab Affairs Department engages in the penetration of 
extremist political parties such as MAKI (the Communist Party of 
Israel); RAKAH (the new Communist List), a largely Arab-supported 
splinter group; SIAH (the New Israel Left); and anti-Zionist and extreme
 rightist organizations. The Department also investigates 
counterfeiting, blackmarketing, the smuggling of money and goods in and 
out of the country, and violations of the economic control laws. It is 
responsible for tapping telephone lines and intercepting domestic and 
diplomatic telephone conversations.

</p><p>The Non-Arab Affairs Department is responsible for foreign 
liaison and handles all correspondence by Shin Beth with other foreign 
intelligence and security services. The interrogation of immigrants from
 the USSR and Eastern European nations is also undertaken by this 
department.

</p><p>The Protective Security Department is responsible for the 
protection of Israeli Government buildings and embassies, El&nbsp;Al and
 Zim installations and craft, defense industries and scientific 
establishments, and leading personalities. This department is also 
charged with the security of all important industrial plants, especially
 those of actual or potential military value, and is engaged in the 
prevention of leakage of industrial secrets such as patents, processes, 
statistics, etc. It also carries on liaison with security officers 
throughout the Israeli Government. Although guards and security officers
 are paid by the instituions to which they are assigned, their 
recruitment, training, and control is a Shin Beth responsibility. The 
Protective Security Department controls the security of internal 
communications and the secrecy of information. A&nbsp;small unit within 
the department, for example, handles all matters concerning espionage 
with the Office of Mail and Telegraph Censorship.

</p><p>The Protective Security Deparment directs Shin Beth security 
activities overseas including the protection of Israeli personnel, 
diplomatic and transport offices, facilities and equipment. Although 
Mossad has responsibility for unilateral operations and liaison on 
intelligence matters and Military Intelligence controls the attache 
system and military liaison, Shin Beth handles protective security and 
liaison with local security services abroad to safeguard Israeli 
personnel and property. For instance, there is a regional Protective 
Security office in Paris which is concerned primarily with El&nbsp;Al 
and Zim security.

</p><p>The Operational Support Department is responsible for assisting 
the operational departments with surveillance, observation, airport 
security, censorship, listening devices, special tasks and counteraudio 
support. This department has tactical components, which aid in 
counterintelligence operations, VIP protection and telephone taps. The 
Department provides support in running a highly developed intercept 
operation from a switchboard installed in Shin Beth offices. This 
enables the service to avoid having to make taps either across pairs in a
 local box or even in the telephone centrals under the jurisdiction of 
the Ministry of Communications Telephone Services; and also avoids any 
possible compromise by leftist employees of the Telephone Services.

</p><p>The Technology Department lends support to the operating 
departments in electronics, mechanics, and chemistry. It provides 
technical support to operations in the following areas: audio and visual
 surveillance, communications, photography, surreptitious entry, 
telephone taps, mail censorship, security devices, etc.

</p><p>The Interrogation and Legal Counsel Department handles all 
counterintelligence and security interrogations for Shin Beth operating 
departments not handed over to the Special Tasks Division of the police.
 This department makes selective use of the polygraph. It also checks 
the reliability of Mossad sources, fabricators, and suspect double 
agents. Personnel in this component travel to the field as required to 
give polygraph tests and conduct interrogations. The department also 
assists in preparing cases for trial and provides other legal assistance
 to operating departments as needed.

</p><p>The Coordination and Planning Department has responsibility for 
coordination of counterintelligence and security methodology, training, 
security recruitment and the central registry. This department maintains
 the Shin Beth card files, with the exception of those on Arabs. In 
addition to ordinary carding procedures, there is an entry on every 
individual in the country who has a police record. This enables all 
government offices to make a quick check on the police record of present
 or potential employees through Shin Beth. All tracing procedures are 
channeled into this department, from name checks through neighborhood 
investigations. This registry uses a military computer. The registry on 
Arabs is not yet computerized because of the difficulty with Arabic 
names.

</p><p>The Administration Department performs the usual functions of 
personnel management, finance, supply, transport, communications, and 
security.

</p><p>A policy body within Shin Beth is called the Directorate of the 
Service. It normally meets once a month. Membership consists of 
department directors (including the regional directors), all of whom are
 of equal rank.

<a name="24"></a></p><h4>3.&nbsp; Administrative practices</h4>

<p>The Director of Shin Beth is appointed by the Prime Minister who may 
seek advice for the appointment but needs no approval from either the 
cabinet or the Knesset.

</p><p>Shin Beth is responsible for the security of all civilian 
intelligence and security personnel. Furthermore, it also recruits and 
selects personnel, according to specific requirements based on loyalty 
to the state, education, capability and potential, and subject to the 
approval of the individual civilian service. The military is somewhat 
more autonomous in regard to security procedures relating to their 
personnel because military security components handle most of their 
cases. Shin Beth, however, sets the policies and standards for military 
security controls.

</p><p>Among the 500 officers in Shin Beth are some 100 individuals who 
have been selected, screened, and trained to serve as security officers 
throughout the governmental structure. These officers are stationed in 
the Prime Minister' s office, intelligence and security components 
including Mossad, scientific institutes, El&nbsp;Al installations, and 
foreign service posts.

</p><p>Most career employees, a few of whom are women, have broad 
educational backgrounds and experience. About one-third of Shin Beth 
officers are assigned abroad early in their careers as security officers
 where they come under the operational and administrative control of 
Mossad. Upon return to Israel from foreign assignment, Shin Beth 
officers revert to the internal security service. Because senior Mossad 
and Shin Beth officers are given identical training in a combined 
advanced operational school, their modus operandi is similar.

</p><p>There is a certain amount of personnel exchange among the 
services. Shin Beth may accept an army major or colonel on temporary 
assignment or recruit a retiring officer on a permanent basis. All 
recruits are subject to a thorough background security investigation 
culminating in a physical examination, polygraph tests, and psychiatric 
screening. Security checks on native born Israelis are relatively easy 
to do, for the young Israeli, whose life is well documented, rarely 
enjoys the luxury of privacy. Police files, school records, university 
professors, army records, youth movements, political affiliations, 
voting records, family history, political persuasions, and friends are 
scrutinized. If the applicant is foreign born, detailed immigration 
records may reveal pertinent information which can be cross-checked. 
Loyalty to Israel is the principal criterion. If the subject was a 
Zionist from early youth, he belongs to a special category; if he has 
never belonged to the leftist parties, MARAM, MAKI and RAKAH, or to 
Herut, a rightist party, his employement opportunities are considerably 
enhanced. It is almost impossible for a Jew to disguise his past when he
 is once in the hands of the authorities since there are in Israel many 
thoroughly reliable persons from every country which has or had a Jewish
 community, who can be consulted for information on potential recruits.

</p><p>The Director of Shin Beth is a civil service Class&nbsp;I 
officer. He has an expense and entertainment allowance. There is a 
rather insignificant differential between grades which is compensated by
 fairly impressive perquisites, including living quarters, 
transportation and travel, especially in the senior ranks.

<a name="25"></a></p><h4>4.&nbsp; Methods of Operation</h4>

<p>Shin Beth operations within Israel can be broken down into the four 
following categories: against foreigners in general, against Arabs, 
against Communists, and against Israelis. There appears to be little 
difference in the application of techniques, but a greater [sic] deal in
 intensity, much of which is directed against the Arabs.

</p><p>The activities and opinions of diplomats both witin and outside 
their diplomatic establishments in Israel are of primary interest to 
Shin Beth. Generally, the Israeli Government tends to regard diplomats 
as being there to ferret information rather than to promote cordial 
relations.

</p><p>The degree of suspicion and intensity of operations against 
diplomats is conditioned by the prevailing relations between countries 
and their long-term diplomatic objectives. Shin Beth operations with the
 police and Military Intelligence are well coordinated. The Israeli 
police work very closely with Shin Beth in guarding foreign 
installations such as embassies and consulates, and in surveilling 
diplomats, foreign journalists, and tourists of special interest. Police
 officers maintain a 24-hour watch in front of all embassies, legations,
 consulates, and ambassadorial residences. They record the comings and 
goings of foreign personnel, especially diplomatic officers who appear 
after regular office hours or on weekends. They also record the license 
numbers of vehicles in which the officers arrive and depart. Diplomatic 
license plates differ in color from civilian plates and carry a 
numerical prefix which identifies the country represented.

</p><p>The security of the border areas and the occupied territories is 
mainly the responsibility of Military Intelligence, the Border guard and
 Shin Beth. Through the use of informants, who may be local Arabs or 
Oriental Jews posing as Arabs, Shin Beth has penetrated subversive Arab 
elements including communist cells and Arab nationalist groups. They 
have also picked up local Arab espionage agents on their way back to 
neighboring countries and doubled them in coordination with Military 
Intelligence. Shin Beth is continually active in the fight against 
terrorism.

</p><p>Aside from the Arab target, Shin Beth is primarily concerned with
 the subversive elements of the left. MAKI and RAKAH owe their 
allegiance to the USSR but being legal parties, they have had 
representatives in the Knesset. Shin Beth has thoroughly penetrated the 
cells of the Communist apparatus, following its activities through 
informants, surveillance, and technical operations. Shin Beth agents 
attend many international Communist front meetings.

</p><p>Since all foreigners, regardless of nationality or religion, 
including Jews, are considered potential threats to the State of Israel,
 Shin Beth employs a large number of informants among local Israelis who
 are in contact with foreigners by reason of their employment or 
activities. In this category are bartenders, hotel clerks, telephone 
operators, secretaries, taxi drivers, caterers, maids, prostitutes, 
chauffeurs, and waiters. It also includes trade unionists, scientists, 
and others in the educational field.

</p><p>There is an Israeli law that authorizes the police and the 
security services to pick up and detain for questioning any Israeli 
citizen who is in contact with foreigners without official persmission 
or obvious reason such as employment or business. Since diplomats are 
subject to surveillance, Shin Beth soon becomes aware of their contacts 
with Israeli citizens. When a pattern develops, and suspicion is 
aroused, attempts are made to develop further information using wire 
tapping and other technical aids. It is not uncommon for representatives
 of Shin Beth to call on the Israeli and attempt to enlist his 
cooperation. If the individual refuses, the penal Revision Law (State 
Security) is cited to him and he is threatened with dire consequences. 
This usually evokes compliance. The Isaeli security authorities also 
seek evidence of illicit love affairs which can be used as leverage to 
enlist cooperation. In one instance, Shin Beth tried to penetrate the US
 Consulate General in Jerusalem through a clerical employee who was 
having an affair with a Jerusalem girl. They rigged a fake abortion case
 against the employee in an unsuccessful effort to recruit him. Before 
this attempt at blackmail, they had tried to get the Israeli girl to 
elicit information from her boyfriend.

</p><p>Two other important targets in Israel are the US Embassy in Tel 
Aviv and the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) with 
headquarters in Jerusalem. There have been two or three crude efforts to
 recruit Marine guards for monetary reward. In the cases affecting UNTSO
 personnel, the operations involved intimidation and blackmail.

</p><p>In 1954, a hidden microphone planted by the Israelis was 
discovered in the Office of the US Ambassador in Tel Aviv. In 1956, 
telephone taps were found connected to two telephones in the residence 
of the US military attache. In 1960, a microphone was discovered behind 
the wall plaster in what had been the office of the Operations Officer 
in the Jordan Israel Mixed Armistice Commission Office.

</p><p>Recently, the Director of the Shin Beth, in testimony before a 
judicial committee of the Knesset, stated that Shin Beth makes entries 
and taps telephones in Israel with some frequency. Reportedly, the only 
concern of the committee members was with the disposition by Shin Beth 
of acquired information which did not bear on national security. It is 
noted that these activities have no basis in law and are conducted on 
the authority of the Director of Shin Beth alone.

</p><p>The Israelis have shown themselves to be most adept at 
surveillance and surreptitious entry operations. Men and women 
frequently are used together on surveillance teams in order to allay 
suspicion. If a person under surveillance stops to use a public 
telephone, the surveillance team reports the situation to the control 
center which immediately notifies the telephone tapping unit and an 
attempt is made to intercept the call. The conversation or pertinent 
information is then related to the team on street. Shin Beth personnel 
are experts at entering private quarters where they go through visitors'
 luggage and personal papers. Special portable camera equipment is used 
for this purpose and the results are processed in the Shin Beth 
laboratory. Shin beth technicians have concealed radio transmitters in 
phonograph cases, in the false bottoms of coffee cans, and in the 
bottoms of portable cooking stoves which can be used as stoves without 
removing the communication equipment.

<a name="26"></a></p><h3>D.&nbsp; Military Intelligence</h3>

<a name="27"></a><h4>1.&nbsp; Functions</h4>

<p>Military intelligence is charged with the collection, production and 
dissemination of military, geographic and economic intelligence, 
especially on the Arab nations, and security in the Defense Forces and 
Administered Territories. This component is an element of the Israeli 
Ministry of Defense and a part of the Defense Forces General Staff. The 
Director of Military Intelligence (DMT) is a member of Va'adat. Although
 Air Force and Navy Intelligence officers are subordinate to their 
respective commanders, they are members of the DMI's staff and attend 
his staff meetings.

<a name="28"></a></p><h4>2.&nbsp; Organization</h4>

<p>Military Intelligence headquarters consist of the following 
departments: (1) Production; (2) the Intelligence Corps; (3) Foreign 
Relations; and (4) Field Security and Military Censorship. The DMI also 
directs Field Security Units, Territorial Command Combat Intelligence 
and Air Force and Navy Intelligence through coordination with their 
respective area commanders (<a href="http://www.serendipity.li/cia/counterspy/figure_7.jpg">Figure&nbsp;7</a>).

</p><p>The Production Department is responsible for preparing the 
national intelligence estimates (versions of which appear as the Middle 
East Review or Survey for distribution to friendly liaison services). 
This department also produces daily finished intelligence reports and 
daily bulletins, which contains [sic] raw or partially analyzed 
information. Estimates are now prepared by Military Intelligence, Mossad
 and the Research and Planning Center of the Ministry for Foreign 
Affairs. The Production Department has about 40 percent (approximately 
2,800) of the personnel of Military Intelligence. About 600, of whom 150
 are officers and analysts, are involved in intelligence production. The
 number of analysts, however, varies as specialists are coopted by the 
department for special studies in technical and economic matters. This 
department is under the command of a deputy director of Military 
Intelligence.

</p><p>The Production Department is divided into the following units (1)
 Geographical (or Regional) Division; (2) Functional (or Technical) 
Division and (3) Documentation (or Registry and Records) Division. The 
Geographical Division evaluates information and compiles target studies 
on the Arab countries. It is divided into three area desks: the Western,
 consisting of Egypt, Sudan and Libya; the Eastern, consisting of Iraq, 
Syria and Lebanon, and the Southern, consisting of Jordan and the 
Arabian Peninsula. Every effort is made in this division to create the 
narrowest type of specialist — a man who can devote himself to his 
material for over a period of years. For example, in the middle 1960s 
the Jordanian Desk Chief had held his job for 15 years and probably knew
 more about the Jordanian military than most Jordanian Army officers.

</p><p>The Functional Division is broken down into substantive units 
which deal with such subjects as Near Eastern economics, inter-Arab 
relations, Palestinian affairs and international activities in the Near 
East. The division produces intelligence on technical and economic 
matters, including weapons and electronics and production, and area 
developments. The unit draws heavily on the knowledge of the IDF 
technical services. There is close cooperation between the geographical 
and functional divisions in producing accurate and timely intelligence. 
The existence of a desk concerned with international activities in the 
Near East, including Soviet affairs, indicates that the functional 
division deals with the policies of other nations as they affect the 
area.

</p><p>The Documentation Division actually employs over half of the 
personnel in the Production Department. All reports are sent first to 
this component, which keeps a permanent record copy and numbers, cards, 
indexes and cross-references documents as necessary. It then forwards 
copies to appropriate offices. The Documentation Division reportedly has
 now installed computers to aid in the dissemination and research 
support process. The registry component of this unit services the entire
 Military Intelligence establishment. This Division is the repository 
for all Military Intelligence reports and publication and is responsible
 for the dissemination of finished intelligence and also supervises the 
intelligence operations center, which operates 24 hours a day. This 
center is the terminal for all direct access field communications and 
presumably is designed to provide rapid review and dissemination of 
information in a crisis situation.

</p><p>The Intelligence corps is responsible for overt and covert 
collection operations, including all signal intelligence activities for 
the Israeli intelligence community, and for operational support 
functions. The Corps is subordinate to the DMI and is under the command 
of the Chief intelligence Officer. This unit consists of a large 
headquarters staff which supervises subordinate operational field 
elements. Although it has no authority over area command assets, the 
Corps may levy requirements on these field elements. The Corps 
supervises the use of technical devices in operations. All requirements 
levied on the Corps must be validated by the Deputy Director of Military
 Intelligence.

</p><p>The Corps is broken down into the following divisions: (1) 
Collection, responsible for signals intelligence, agent operations, 
overt sources and long distance obeservation units; (2) General 
Headquarters which is in charge of the military intelligence school, the
 Technical Development Institute, communications and cartography; (3) 
Training; (4) Organization, Logistics and Personnel; and (5) Research 
and Development.

</p><p>The signals branch of the collection Division, which includes 
communications and electronic intelligence and landline operations, 
collects communications intelligence for the entire intelligence and 
security community. The actual collection operation is performed by the 
IDF Signal Corps. The Israeli Air Force also participates and maintains 
liaison with other service components on electronic warfare. The 
Israelis have been very successful in their COMINT and ELINT operations 
against the Arabs. During the Six-Day War in 1967 the Israelis succeeded
 in intercepting, breaking and disseminating a tremendous volume of Arab
 traffic quickly and accurately, including a high level conversation 
between the late President Gamal Abd-Nasser of the UAR and King Hussein 
of Jordan. Over the years the Israelis have mounted cross-border 
operations and tapped Arab landline communications for extended periods.
 The Israelis have also on occasion boobytrapped the landlines.

</p><p>The Agents Branch is in charge of all agent operations run by 
Military Intelligence. The Branch is not permitted to run agent 
operations abroad but it has sole jurisdiction over agent operations 
across the borders of Israel into neighboring states. The Agents Branch 
has executive authority over Shin Beth operations which are run against 
the intelligence service of a neighboring Arab State. Egypt and Syria 
are the prime operational targets. The Interrogation Unit of the Agents 
Branch controls POW interrogation teams which are especially trained and
 prepared to accompany any major IDF military operation beyond the 
ceasefire lines. These teams are keystones in Military Intelligence 
tactical operations. Interrogators use a variety of deception techniques
 in questioning prisoners. Although prisoners are usually treated well, 
interrogators may give the initial impression that other prisoners have 
been mistreated or even executed for failure to cooperate. 
Arabic-speaking IDF interrogators sometimes pose as Arab officers and 
circulate among prisoners to elicit information. These techniques 
usually produce a large quantity of information from captured enemy 
personnel.

</p><p>The Open Sources Division collects and collates all material from
 overt sources. This component, however, does not evaluate the 
information.

</p><p>The Long Distance Observation Units are primarily concerned with 
visual sightings of Arab activity along the borders and armistice lines.
 These units also provide support to agent cross-border operations and 
leads to signal intelligence units based on observations of Arab 
movements across the borders.

</p><p>The General Headquarters Division runs the Military Intelligence 
School and the Technical Development Institute and is in charge of 
communications and cartography. DMI has the largest technical capability
 of any of the Israeli intelligence services. It has a highly competent 
RD&amp;E component which produces equipment needed for military 
intelligence operations. Because it is the largest, and at one time the 
only, engineering shop in the Israeli intelligence community, it takes 
on some projects from other services.

</p><p>The Communications Branch handles all matters involving wireless 
communication for agent operations. Officials in this branch train agent
 operators, draw up signal plans, and maintain radio contact with agents
 in place. From time to time this branch also provides support for 
Mossad and Shin Beth.

</p><p>The Cartographic Branch has responsibility for map production and
 works in close cooperation with the Director of the Survey Department 
in the Ministry of Labor. There are approximately 300 personnel assigned
 to the Map Survey Office (Survey of Israel). Offices are located near 
the intersection of Lincoln and Yehuda Halevi streets in Tel Aviv.

</p><p>The Training Division is responsible for the intelligence 
doctrine taught in the Military Intelligence School and in troop units. 
It has evidently absorbed the training responsibilities of Field 
Security and Combat Intelligence units. The Military Intelligence School
 curriculum includes combat intelligence, strategic intelligence and 
"special studies." The school may provide some training for personnel of
 other Israeli intelligence and security services.

</p><p>The Organization, Logistics and Personnel Division is responsible
 for administrative tasks. The head of this division functions as the 
DMI's designee on all logistical and personnel matters. The division 
consists of three components: Logistics, Personnel and Finance.

</p><p>The Research and Development Division is primarily concerned with
 computer operations and programming in support of Military Intelligence
 production, operations and requirements.

</p><p>The Foreign Relations Department is responsible for liaison 
between the IDF and foreign military organizations and for Israeli 
Defense Attache affairs. This department is reportedly divided into two 
companies: the Foreign Intelligence Liaison Division and the Attaches' 
Division. The Foreign Intelligence Liaison Division conducts liaison 
with representatives of foreign intelligence services which have 
agreements with Military Intelligence. This division also has control 
over visits by officers and training of troops from foreign countries in
 Israel. Foreign Intelligence Liaison is also the official point of 
contact for all foreign defense attaches in Israel. Activities such as 
visits to installations, exchanges of routine information, briefing 
sessions, etc. must first be cleared with Field Security and submitted 
to the DMI for a policy decision, if necessary. Attaches accredited or 
otherwise working in Israel on intelligence matters can expect to 
receive select information concerning other Near East and foreign 
nations within perimeters set by the DMI, thus an attache seeking 
information on specific questions of Israeli capabilities and materials 
would receive the data through this division. It is considered a 
"violation" of IDF "unwritten" policy for foreign military personnel in 
Israel to collect this type of information in any other way. In the 
past, Military Intelligence has provided much information on technical 
equipment supplied to other Middle East nations by the Soviet Bloc. This
 was especially true in the wake of the Arab-Israeli War in 1967, when 
the Israelis captured vast quantities of Soviet material from the Arabs.
 It is believed that Foreign Intelligence Liaison may be divided into at
 least two components: General Intelligence and Technical Intelligence.

</p><p>Within or attached to the Foreign Intelligence Liaison division 
is a Secret Liaison unit which handles all operations outside the normal
 charter of activities previously described. This unit may be involved 
either directly or indirectly in bilateral intelligence operations 
conducted by Military Intelligence with other services. Thus when a 
special relationship between a foreign military establishment and the 
IDF is arranged, this unit supplies the officers and controls the 
activities. This unit was involved in the excellent liaison relationship
 which at one time existed with France. Further, if Mossad decides that 
an Israeli military officer is in the best position to carry out a 
specific foreign operation, this unit will handle the matter. Operations
 controlled from this office in all cases are coordinated with Mossad.

</p><p>The Foreign Relations Department directs the activities of 
Israeli ministry of Defense Missions and Defense Attaches abroad through
 the Attaches' Division. Ministry of Defense Missions and Israeli 
Defense Attaches are located in Washington, New York City, London, 
Paris, Bonn, Rome, The Hague, Ankara, Teheran, Bangkok, Buenos Aires, 
Tokyo, Brasilia and Caracas. Several of these attaches are also 
accredited to adjacent countries. The true role of most defense missions
 and attache posts is to sell Israeli defense industry products and 
purchase defense equipment for the IDF. There are few posts which are 
actually attache offices in the traditional sense, the principal ones 
being in Washington, London, and Paris. Israeli defense attaches abroad 
advise their respective ambassadors, report on host country military 
matters, keep abreast of all research and development in the host 
country and in general, represent the IDF abroad. Attaches also do 
operational support work for Mossad. Israeli military missions have been
 sent to some countries for training and support purposes, but those 
missions have not been officially accredited to the country concerned.

</p><p>The Field Security and Military Censorship Department is 
responsible for counterintelligence within the IDF, and conducts 
physical and personnel security investigations. Field Security is also 
responsible for security clearances of all personnel assigned to 
Military Intelligence. This Department conducts daily liaison with Shin 
Beth, which is responsible for IDF reserve personnel on inactive status 
and has final responsibility in counterintelligence and security cases. 
In the middle 1960s the Security Department included a Personnel 
Security Division to assign personnel, supervise and coordinate 
clearances and conduct surveillance. A&nbsp;Counterintelligence Division
 had the responsibility of ensuring security regarding communications, 
documents and installations. An Education and Training Division was 
responsible for troop security indoctrination. A&nbsp;computerized 
document checking office was set up in the early 1960s to control 
distribution and disposal of all Top Secret documents originating within
 the IDF. The field Security Department coordinates and monitors the 
activities of Field Security units attached to the IDF territorial 
commands to maintain order. Each territorial commander is responsible 
for security in his area and uses Field Security units to preserve law 
and order. Israel is divided into Northern, Central and Southern 
commands plus the Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa districts. Both Tel Aviv
 District and the Central Command, also located there, are separate from
 IDF General Headquarters which is located in Tel Aviv. The Gaza Strip, 
although not contiguous to the Central Command, has been placed under 
that Command because pacification and antiterrorist operations in the 
past few years have succeeded in bringing relative stability to the 
area. Sinai is under the Southern Command, which has two Field Security 
units. In the mid-1960s the Northern Command has three Field Security 
units.

</p><p>Field Security officers serve in the territorial commands where 
they direct the activities of various Field Security units and serve as 
points of contact for the Commands Security Departments and the 
territorial commanders. Field Security units are responsible for 
implementing and supervising security directives, including 
instructions, guidance and inspections. In the Administered Territories,
 Field Security units cooperate with Shin Beth and the Border Guard to 
preserve security, combat terrorism and run counterintelligence 
operations. At brigade level in the three area commands, Field Security 
has military intelligence majors serving as security officers (and known
 as such) under the command of the Operations Section (G-3). Security 
officers at battalion and company level are "coopted" from the infantry 
but are known as security officers only to unit commanders on the 
battalion level. At the company level, security personnel are sergeants.

</p><p>The Military Censorship Office within the Field Security and 
Military Censorship Department is responsible for all censorship. In 
addition this component, by law, has extremely wide powers in dealing 
with the Israeli press and other mass media. In practice, the IDF has 
found it advisable to operate on a gentleman's agreement basis and 
depend largely on the good intentions of editors and the like to refrain
 from publishing stories about Israeli military secrets. This office 
operates on behalf of the entire IDF. Directors of Military Intelligence
 in the past have referred to Military Censorship as part of the 
"ballast" that they would prefer to see in the Chief of Staff's own 
office. The Chief of the Censorship Office is a member of the "Committee
 of Three" which acts as a Board of Appeal and final arbiter in all 
matters relating to censorship. The two other members are a 
representative of the press and a representative of the public at large.
 The last named must be agreed upon by both other parties. In effect all
 information is broken down into three categories: (1) items that are 
permitted without question, (2) items that are not permitted under any 
circumstances, and (3) items that must be cleared before publication. 
Blank spaces are found only infrequently in the press owing to a 
regulation which forbids this practice; for example, an entire page must
 be reset if a single item must be withdrawn from publication. All IDF 
publications and press releases must be coordinated with and approved by
 the Censorship Office. All information media, foreign and domestic, 
must submit any item having a security or significant political 
implication to the Censorship Office prior to its release. Most press 
organizations have a teletype link with the IDF to expedite this 
process; others must handcarry their items to the office. In the 
mid-1960s, this office was staffed largely by female soldiers.

</p><p>The Censorship Office is in charge of monitoring outgoing 
communications from Israel to ensure that no information of military 
value is transmitted. If the monitor hears a discussion involving 
matters of military importance, he will cut off the conversation. On one
 occasion a monitor reportedly listened in on a private conversation and
 reported gleefully to his colleagues in the room what he heard. The 
monitor was fired on the spot. Monitoring activity concentrates largely 
on international telephone calls from foreign media personnel in Israel 
to their home offices abroad.

</p><p>The Public Relations Office of Military Censorship has 
responsiblity for all IDF press releases and all official contacts with 
the public. The Office handles relations with the press and the public 
in coordination with the Censorship Office. The Office also hosts 
foreign defense attaches in Israel in conjunction with the Foreign 
Intelligence Liaison Division. As in the case of the Censorship Office, 
Directors of Military Intelligence would prefer to see the Public 
Relations Office directly under the command of the Chief of Staff.

</p><p>The intelligence process within Military Intelligence operates 
largely by means of three regularly scheduled meetings of the key 
intelligence officers. First, there is a meeting twice a week or every 
three days at which the Director of the Production Department holds a 
briefing for the DMI and other top officers. Depending on the nature of 
the intelligence discussed, other production officers may also be 
present. On the basis of this meeting, the DMI issues instructions for 
action or levies requirements for information to the assembled staff 
officers. One half day after each of these biweekly meetings, the 
directors of Production and the Intelligence Corps meet to work out 
detailed planning and tactics on what each should do to follow up the 
DMI's broad directives. Immediately after this, the director of the 
Intelligence Corps gathers together his own division chiefs and gives 
them guidelines for carrying out their immediate responsibilities. The 
liaison officer assigned to Mossad sits in on this meeting.

</p><p>The DMI is always given finished intelligence. Individual items 
are summarized in not more than half a page and broken down into three 
paragraphs: (1) the facts; (2) comments; and (3) evaluation. These are 
put together on a "reading board" for selected top Israeli Government 
officials with appropriate marginal comments from the DMI. There are in 
addition daily, weekly, and monthly intelligence summaries which are 
designed to provide a continuing insight into the development of events 
or trends of interest to the government. These summaries, together with 
spot reports on separate items, fulfill much of the DMI's 
responsiblities as the Prime Minister's staff officer for intelligence. 
The Production Department may also generate special research or "think" 
pieces. Special reports are also written in response to requirements 
levied by Israeli agencies other than military intelligence.

</p><p>One of the DMI's most important functions is to present the 
annual intelligence estimate during the latter part of December. While a
 precis is drawn up beforehand, the presentation is oral and is attended
 by senior government officials headed by the Prime Minister. The DMI 
uses the weekly summaries to a great extent in preparing his material. 
At the end of his formal remarks, the DMI opens the floor to questions. 
The minutes of the meeting are then put into finished form and 
circulated to key government officers on a need-to-know basis.

</p><p>The DMI's major aid in doing his job is a progress report drawn 
up every three months by each of his department directors. He also reads
 raw intelligence reports from time to time for the purpose of getting 
the actual flavor of information presented to him in the special item 
reports or to evaluate the usefulness or nature of agent operations.

</p><p>Although the DMI has an elaborate computer capability to assist 
in collating information, there is a need for more effective automatic 
data-processing equipment for the storage and retrieval of information.

</p><p>The DMI assigns intelligence officers to the three Area Commands,
 where they are attached to the various intelligence staffs down to 
brigade level. Territorial commanders direct the collection of 
intelligence in their geographical areas and for some distance across 
the border. The Northern Command is responsible for operations against 
Lebanon and Syria while the Central Command controls operations against 
Jordan, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia. Information is collected through
 border observation, reconnaissance patrols and cross-border operations.

</p><p>Air Force and Navy Intelligence are small, highly specialized 
units concentrating on items of immediate concern to only the Air Force 
and Navy commands. The Directors of Air Force and Navy Intelligence 
attend the staff meetings of the DMI. Officers from each of these 
services are detailed to attend the regular meetings of the Research 
Department in order to coordinate reporting responsibility. Officers 
from both services are also permanently assigned to the Collection 
Department to coordinate requirements which are of particular concern to
 them.

<a name="29"></a></p><h5>2a.&nbsp; Air Force Intelligence</h5>

<p>Israeli Air Force Intelligence is a relatively small but efficient 
organization. Its main functions are to conduct intelligence operations 
necessary to support air activities and to coordinate with the DMI 
regarding its collection efforts. Air Force intelligence is concerned 
almost exclusively with Arab air order of battle and the collection of 
Arab serial target data. This information is largely collected by aerial
 reconnaissance and SIGINT, with supplementary information provided by 
agent reports and prisoner interrogations in hot war situations. The IDF
 relies heavily on photoreconnaissance for order of battle information. 
The Air Force has two photointerpretation facilities, but probably does 
not have more than 20 imagery interpreters. In 1970, all Air Force 
Intelligence facilities were permanent, although the Israelis planned to
 acquire several mobile facilities. While Air Force Intelligence does 
not produce estimates, it does prepare intelligence studies on air order
 of battle, threats and capabilies. The Air Force administers its own 
attaches abroad.

</p><p>Air force procedures for handling imagery intelligence are highly
 centralized yet flexible. Israeli photoreconnaissance capabilities, 
however, are limited. Photgraphic coverage is not possible below 7,000 
feet, and camera systems are not capable of revealing, for example, 
whether SAM (surface to air missile) sites are occupied. Additionally, 
Air Force photolaboratory quality control is almost nonexistent. Air 
Force Intelligence, despite its high standards, did not have enough 
imagery interpreters at the time of the Yom Kippur War and the overall 
skill level of those few was rather low.

<a name="30"></a></p><h5>2b.&nbsp; Naval Intelligence</h5>

<p>Naval Intelligence is a small, centralized service of approximately 
110 people operating in support of Navy units. Most of the personnel are
 located in the Navy headquarters building in Tel Aviv. The service 
deals mostly with naval order of battle, foreign capabilities and 
seaborne threats. Naval Intelligence operates as a semiautonomous unit 
of Military Intelligence and is not obliged to provide personnel at the 
national intelligence level. Naval Intelligence personnel are not 
subordinate to the DMI except to give consultative assistance in naval 
matters. In the table of organization, the Director of Naval 
Intelligence falls under the Officer Commanding the Navy for operational
 and reporting matters and supports the top navy commands. The service 
is patterned after the Military Intelligence structure but is geared for
 the requirements and scope of navy functions and missions. The 
organization has a deputy director and Collection, Targeting, Production
 (Research) and Security Departments. It assigns officers to the naval 
bases at Haifa, Ashdod, Elat, Sharm el Shaykh and a commando unit based 
in southern Sinai. There is also a Protocol Department, which deals with
 foreign naval attaches in Israel, and a small organization and 
administration department (<a href="http://www.serendipity.li/cia/counterspy/figure_8.jpg">Figure&nbsp;8</a>).

</p><p>The Collection Department, with about 17 personnel, is one of the
 smaller components in the Naval Intelligence structure. It has few 
integral operational resources and support for most of its collection 
efforts must come from or be coordinated through the DMI. Exceptions to 
this arrangement are Collection Department control of Israeli naval 
attache activities abroad, small boat coastal operations, COMINT, ELINT 
and aerial reconnaissance in cooperation with Air Force Intelligence, 
and a merchant marine program. The post-World War II Israeli endeavor in
 clandestine arms procurement and illegal immigration developed 
important commercial and shipping contacts, some of which may still be 
handled by or at least coordinated with Naval Intelligence.

</p><p>The Targeting Department, with about 20 personnel, is divided 
into two divisions: Syria/Lebanon and Egypt/North Africa. These 
divisions are responsible for (1) preparing coastal studies for naval 
gunfire missions; (2) preparing beach studies for amphibious assualts; 
(3) preparing special target studies to support commando operations; and
 (4) preparing and maintaining target folder [sic] on Lebanese, Syrian 
and Egyptian ports. The Department has access to all sources of 
information available to the DMI. In addition to levying requirements 
for collection on the Military Intelligence Collection Department, the 
Director of Naval Intelligence is on regular distribution for 
information obtained by the DMI related to naval affairs.

</p><p>The Production Department, with a staff of about 40, is the 
largest component of Naval Intelligence. This unit is divided into two 
divisions: (1) Arab Navies; and (2) the Soviet Navy. The Production 
Department handles research, analysis, production and dissemination of 
information on all mobile forces associated with Arab navies and the 
Soviet Navy in the Mediterranean. This component is the primary user of 
all source material which flows into the Naval headquarters, especially 
SIGINT information. The work of this department is mainly in support of 
units operating out of the four naval bases and the commando unit in 
southern Sinai. Production is limited largely to studies on enemy order 
of battle and special weapons. Those studies and others, including 
target folders, identification manuals and enemy tactics outlines, are 
disseminated to operational commanders and crews through the base 
intelligence officers. The base intelligence officer disseminates such 
information by briefing crews or updating a ship's intelligence library 
through additions, updates and changes.

</p><p>The Security Department, which has a staff of about 12, performs a
 limited counterintelligence function within Navy headquarters at all 
naval bases. Security Department personnel are navy officers and 
enlisted men who have been specially trained by the Field Security 
Department of Military Intelligence. They perform basic 
countersubversion and countersabotage tasks at headquarters and at 
subordinate bases. They do not, however, carry out base security or 
personnel investigations, which are done by Military Intelligence Field 
Security units.

</p><p>The Organization and Administration Department with about six 
personnel assigned, provides seccretarial support for the Director of 
Naval Intelligence. These personnel handle routine administrative 
duties.

</p><p>Naval Intelligence, although small, is a well-trained and 
evidently highly efficient service. Recruiting of personnel into Naval 
Intelligence is done by means of a very efficient, informal system which
 identifies individuals and matches them to the needs of the Director of
 Naval Intelligence. (The system is apparently in force throughout 
Israeli military intelligence organizations.) Naval Intelligence officer
 personnel are recruited through several different channels. Most 
younger junior officers enter directly from the universities while 
others transfer within the navy from naval operations units to the 
intelligence service. A&nbsp;third souce is enlisted personnel who have 
displayed the necessary qualities and have indicated an interest in 
following a career in naval intelligence. Once identified, such people 
are sent to a university at Navy expense. Upon completion of their 
training they are commissioned and pursue careers in Naval Intelligence.
 Israeli Navy enlisted personnel, both male and female, are mostly 
volunteers who have been screened by the Director of Naval Intelligence.
 The Naval Intelligence women serve 20 months, while the men serve 36 
months.

</p><p>There are no special naval intelligence schools in Israel, and 
naval intelligence officers and key enlisted personnel are trained at 
the Military Intelligence School. In general women receive only 
on-the-job training; however, if a woman shows an interest in a naval 
intelligence career, she will be enrolled in the enlisted course of the 
Military Intelligence School. Naval Intelligence enlisted men attend an 
abbreviated course, enrollment in an expanded course depending on 
motivation and intended utilization. There appears to be very little 
problem with the retention of naval intelligence personnel. The primary 
constraint on the Director of Naval Intelligence is the total number 
(officer and enlisted) of slots assigned. The centralized system 
combined with primary area of intelligence interest lends itself very 
well to the Naval Intelligence personnel structure. The close knit 
intelligence support system also works well considering the lack of 
integral collection assets.

</p><p>Intelligence, prior to and during the Yom Kippur War, was 
received in the Operations Center at Naval headquarters. During the war,
 the director of Naval Intelligence worked very closely with the Officer
 Commanding the Navy in the Center during ongoing operations. 
Information from SIGINT and other sources was received in the Center as 
raw data. Correlation of all information was then done on the spot by 
the Chief of Naval Intelligence and passed on to the Officer Commanding 
the Navy. The information was disseminated in the form of orders or 
reports to operational commanders and units. Processing and 
dissemination of naval intelligence was accomplished in a highly 
professional manner with no major deficiencies or Arab naval surprises 
in the Yom Kippur War. Naval Intelligence also revealed a built-in 
flexibility when the service shifted quickly to a hot war situation and 
handled support for active naval opeartations including shore 
bombardment missions. One major area where Naval Intelligence has 
problems is the limited number of personnel. In case of continuous 
operations, similar to the Yom Kippur War, quality naval intelligence 
work would probably degenerate after a month of steady operations.

<a name="31"></a></p><h4>3.&nbsp; Administrative practices of the Directorate of Military Intelligence</h4>

<p>There are approximately 450 officers plus a larger number of NCOs, 
enlisted personnel and civilian clerical peronnel in the DMI. The 
service has priority in the selection of qualified military personnel 
for intelligence assignments. Military Intelligence prefers to bring 
individuals into intelligence work while they are young and move them 
upwards as they acquire experience and can assume greater responsiblity.
 Recruiters seek promising young people who are studying foreign 
languages or other subjects of interest to the service in secondary 
school. Prior to graduation, Military Intelligence officers contact 
selected young students — males and females — and offer them positions 
as interpreters during the two years of compulsory military service 
which follows at the completion of secondary education. Those who accept
 are assigned to Military Intelligence when they join the IDF. Promising
 young army personnel are then sent to the Military Intelligence School,
 following which they may be commissioned and assigned as assistants to 
intelligence officers in the field. When they attain the rank of 
captain, having served as intelligence officers, some are assigned to an
 area command headquarters or to the Directorate of Military 
Intelligence to expand their experience and qualify them for more 
responsiblity and eventual promotion to higher rank. Thus, many of the 
officers now serving with Military Intelligence entered as young men and
 moved up through the ranks.

</p><p>Most Military Intelligence personnel are regulars, not reservists
 because the IDF requires career intelligence officers. All personnel, 
including conscripts, join Military Intelligence voluntarily. Female 
enlisted members, who often serve as translators, usually serve only 20 
months whereas male enlisted personnel serve 36 months.

</p><p>Military Intelligence training is professional and extensive. 
Officers and analysts are well-trained and competent in their fields. 
The Military Intelligence School is located north of Tel Aviv on the 
road to Sde Dov airport. This school trains both officers and 
noncommissioned officers. Approximately 150 instructors and 90 support 
personnel train between 2,000 and 3,000 students annually. The school's 
usual course runs from September through February. This arrangement has 
been made to take advantage of new groups of high school graduates. This
 center is a relatively new facility which was established in the late 
1960s. It was formerly part of the IDF Infantry School.

</p><p>The commander of the Military Intelligence School is responsible 
to the DMI for intelligence instruction and to the Intelligence Corps 
for training in general. Course content is the responsiblity of the DMI.
 The training staff supervises training aids and instruction methods. 
A&nbsp;Combat Intelligence Branch provides instruction for operational 
personnel and a General Subjects Branch trains specialists. The General 
Subjects Branch, for example, teaches courses in field security, 
censorship, military drafting, photo interpretation, research for order 
of battle analysis, collection and serial observation. Other special 
courses are taught as needed. Field Security counterintelligence 
personnel, Air Force and Navy students also take courses at the Military
 Intelligence School and Military Intelligence instructors are 
responsible to the DMI for intelligence training at the schools of other
 IDF branches. They are charged by the DMI for quality of intelligence 
teaching. These instructors usually have wartime assignments with 
tactical units. Military Intelligence personnel staff intelligence 
positions down through brigade level; line officers with intelligence 
training at the Infantry school staff the lower echelons.

</p><p>Field Security personnel are selected on the basis of strict 
criteria regarding personal security and loyalty to Zionism and the 
Israeli State. They are trained by Shin Beth.

</p><p>In general, Military Intelligence, although it has a good 
training program and tries to offer career inducements, has difficulty 
in retaining competent personnel because of low wages and slim 
opportunities for advancement.

<a name="32"></a></p><h4>4.&nbsp; Methods of operation</h4>

<p>Military Intelligence is responsible for cross-border operations into
 the neighboring Arab states. Its operations rely heavily on the 
exploitation of Arabs within Israeli and the Administered Territories; 
Arab students, who though residents of Israel, attend universities in 
the Arab nations; Arab travelers and visitors, Arabs in Israeli prisons;
 and Arab military deserters, defectors, Bedouins and smugglers.

</p><p>Military Intelligence collection requirements cover political and
 economic subjects as well as military information and uses the 
information acquired both for policy making purposes and as basic 
intelligence. Military Intelligence is also active in collecting 
information from sources outside Israeli terrorist and subversive 
organizations and activities. Although SIGINT sources acquire some 
information on these subjects, Military Intelligence officers believe 
that only agent sources can really obtain the data needed on various 
terrorist groups policies and plans, methods of operation, equipment, 
training and relations with other groups. Primary Israeli interest in 
terrorism is to obtain early warning of impending operations.

</p><p>In each regional area of Israel, local citizens, in some cases 
Arabs, who are Israeli agents, act as spotters for Military 
Intelligence. Most of these spotters have long worked for Military 
Intelligence, which alerts them to the type of sources desired. Once a 
spotter has reported a potential source, he steps aside and leaves the 
rest to Military Intelligence officers. Military Intelligence contacts 
the potential source, assesses him and, if appropriate, attempts to 
recruit him as an agent. This is described as the "direct method" of 
recruiting agents for Military Intelligence. The "indirect method" 
refers to recruiting sources by or through agents outside Israel. Both 
Field Security and the police investigate the backgrounds of potential 
agents for Military Intelligence.

</p><p>The motives of the spotters and local support people are either 
monetary or a desire for services in the form of aid in reuniting 
families or representation on behalf of the spotter in some problem with
 the Israeli Government. The basic agent motivation is generally 
economic gain in the form of salaries, loans (which are seldom repaid), 
and gifts. Another common incentive is a wish to move to Israel and 
rejoin relatives who reside there. In some cases the agent may be a 
Palestinian refugee, who believes that he still has a claim to property 
in Israel and wants either recompense or a guarantee of the eventual 
return of his property. Other agents are members of Arab minority groups
 or opponents of Arab regimes.

</p><p>Military Intelligence officers do have problems in handling Arab 
agents, who tend to exaggerate and often fail to report accurate 
details. Therefore, the Military Intelligence officers encourage their 
Arab agents to provide photographs, maps, and other corroborating 
documents. Military Intelligence officers also cross-check reports often
 by using other agents in the same region. Despite Israeli warnings 
during training, Arab agents tend to tell other members of their family 
about their association with Military Intelligence. Occasionally an Arab
 agent may recruit all the members of his immediate family as subagents 
and try to get his case officer to pay them salaries. The Israelis refer
 to these family subagents as "nonfunctionalist." These subagents 
sometimes compromise a whole operation as a result of boasting about 
their activities. Occasionally the Military Intelligence case officer 
will order these unwanted"nonfunctionals" across the border into Israel 
for security briefings but Military Intelligence has not solved this 
problem completely.

</p><p>Military Intelligence trains its agents in tradecraft, collection
 methods, security and reporting procedures. Military Intelligence runs 
its agents in networks or as singletons; the latter are referred to as 
"lone wolves." For security reasons, Military Intelligence prefers that 
an agent with good access remain a "lone wolf." Agent networks consist 
of a primary source and subsources. Military Intelligence does not refer
 to sources as such, instead calling both primary and subsource 
"agents." Military Intelligence officers try to meet and train each 
agent personally on the Israeli side of the border. Networks usually 
include a radio operator and in some cases, a courier.

</p><p>Military Intelligence also communicates with its agents by S/W 
letters posted in third countries, by agent radio and by deaddrops. 
Military Intelligence operations have been marked by flexibility, 
economy in the use of assets and by responsiveness to requirements; the 
system worked well prior to the Yom Kippur War in October 1973. Agents 
reported early warning information which, in retrospect, contained 
reliable indications of a coming Arab attack. Direct communication with 
agents, however, virtually ceased during hostilities and what little 
agent reporting there was during the war was of limited value to Israeli
 Military headquarters and field commanders. The principal problem faced
 by Military Intelligence in the acquistition and reporting of 
intelligence by agents is the lack of modern equipment. Although many of
 the agents have radios (mainly receivers) and cameras, and are familiar
 with secret writing, the sophistication level of techniques and 
equipment is low. This adversely affects the quality, security and 
timeliness of collection operations. Military Intelligence employs a 
SIGINT system that is modern, sophisticated and effective.

</p><p>The DMI is responsible for providing technical support to other 
directorates, but the technical services of the various military 
intelligence directorates are inferior to the technical groups of Shin 
Beth. The DMI's technical equipment, such as that used in audio 
surveillance or that employed in work agent support is generally high 
although it is less good in some special fields such as miniaturization.
 In the use and application of infrared devices, however, the DMI 
capability is usually good. Military Intelligence personnel are capable 
of making ad hoc modifications of existing equipment and are up to date 
on technical advances concerning remote control and activation of 
transmitters, and in the field of low-light photography. Military 
Intelligence relies heavily on aerial reconnaissance and SIGINT for 
timely order of battle information. Aerial reconnaissance is apparently a
 primary instrument for locating fedayeen groups, although such 
organizations are well penetrated by field agents.

</p><p>Military Intelligence is capable of providing timely and detailed
 information on Israel's primary neighboring enemies through agent 
operations that are well planned and highly imaginative.

</p><p>The main purpose of Military Intelligence Field Security units is
 to control the local Arab population in the Administered Territories 
and to minimize their participation in terrorism. In this endeavor, 
Field Security of the Administered Territories works closely with Shin 
Beth and the Border Guard. Residents are required to carry ID cards, 
curfews have been imposed, suspected resistors have been detained, and 
the houses in the area of persons presumed to know of terrorist 
activities have been demolished, even though the inhabitants were not 
directly involved. In the early 1970s it was estimated that the Israelis
 had some 900 residents of the Administered Territories under 
administrative detention. Personnel of Field Security units have carried
 out sweeps in searches for terrorists and arms caches through areas in 
the West Bank where terrorism has occurred. On some occasions Israeli 
operations have taken place at night, apparently intended at least in 
part to intimidate the populace.

</p><p>In December, 1969 the Defense Minister announced that 516 
buildings had been demolished in the occupied territories since the 1967
 war — 265 in the West Bank, 227 in Gaza and 24 in Jerusalem. While 
these Israeli policies and actions have intimidated many Arabs who might
 otherwise have engaged in resistance activities or in terrorism, in 
many cases they have been counterproductive in that they have aroused 
deep and widespread resentment among the residents of the Occupied 
Territories. In areas where buildings have been destroyed, an atmosphere
 of personal anger and resentment has been added to the natural 
bitterness of a defeated people, particularly among the younger Arabs.

<a name="33"></a></p><h4>5.&nbsp; Relations with other services</h4>

<p>There appears at the present time to be a very harmonious 
relationship between Military Intelligence and the other Israeli 
intelligence and security services. Most Israeli intelligence and 
security personnel, especially on the policy and coordination level, 
realize that their very national existence depends on an effective and 
smoothly functioning intelligence and security community. In addition, 
officers at the department chief and even more so at the division chief 
level all have known each other personally for a long period of time. 
These relationships have been forged during troubled times seldom 
experienced by any other nation and now provide a framework for 
cooperative teamwork and coordination among the services.

</p><p>Liaison between Israeli Military Intelligence and foreign 
organizations have varied over the years from good to poor, depending on
 the exigencies of the situation and the demands of policy. In recent 
years the Israelis have provided military and security aid and training 
to various African nations, including Ethiopia, Uganda and Zaire. They 
have also engaged in military and security training and equipment 
exchanges with Latin American and Asian services.

</p><p>The Israelis have maintained good relations with Turkey and Iran 
in military and security matters. While the Israelis do not have full 
diplomatic relations with Iran; they have an overt official mission 
whose members have diplomatic titles, including that of military 
attache.

<a name="34"></a></p><h3>E.&nbsp; Research and political planning Center</h3>

<p>The Research and Political Planning Center, formerly the Research 
Division in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, prepares analysis based on
 raw intelligence for government policy makers. Its office is located in
 a separate fenced compound within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
complex in Jerusalem. A&nbsp;guard at the compound gate prevents 
unauthorized entrance into the Center, and photo ID cards are required 
for admittance.

</p><p>The Center presently employs fewer than 100 people, both analysts
 and support staff, who were recruited from the Minstry of Foreign 
Affairs and Israeli universities. The Center has six divisions: North 
Africa; the Fertile Crescent; the Arabian Peninsula; other Geographic 
Regions; Economic; and Strategic. Some 70 percent of the Center's 
personnel are employed in the three Arab units. The Center prepares its 
analyses on the basis of raw intelligence data available to the Israeli 
intelligence community. The Center produces short papers on current 
intelligence and longer analytical memoranda, as required. The Center's 
products are disseminated to all ministries of the government.

</p><p>The Foreign Minister uses the Center as his personal braintrust 
to give hm an independent means of judging the products of Military 
Intelligence and Mossad. Although its analyses are sent to Israel's top 
decisionmakers, the Center's role in the Israeli intelligence and 
security community probably is still a modest one. The Center reportedly
 has few problems arising from competition within the community, 
probably because of a lack of status in comparison with the established 
and larger intelligence and security organizations.

<a name="35"></a></p><h3>F.&nbsp; The National Police</h3>

<p>The Israeli Police Force is a national organization headed by an 
Inspector General responsible to the Minister of the Interior. The 
national headquarters moved in mid-1969 from Tel Aviv-Yafo to Jerusalem.
 The force is comprised of the following departments: (1) 
Administration, which is responsible for transport, supplies, 
communications, property and finances; (2) Investigations, which is 
concerned with criminal and fraud investigations and special tasks in 
support of the intelligence and security community; and (3) Operations, 
which is in charge of training, patrols and traffic. There are also 
personnel, reasearch, planning and development offices. The Prison 
Services and the Civil Guard are also part of the Police (<a href="http://www.serendipity.li/cia/counterspy/figure_9.jpg">Figure&nbsp;9</a>).

</p><p>The force is divided territorially into districts, subdistricts, 
zones, police stations, and posts. The three police districts are: 
Northern, including Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Southern, including Jerusalem. 
Attached to the Haifa subdistrict is a small coast guard or marine 
police force, which is based in the port of Haifa and patrols the whole 
coastline to prevent smuggling, infiltration, and illegal fishing. This 
unit also has patrol craft on Lake Tiberias and at Elat on the Gulf of 
Aqaba. The Southern District includes a special unit at Ben Gurion (Lod)
 airport (Figures 10 and 11).

</p><p>A special component of the national police force is the Border 
Guard, whose missions are to guard the ceasefire lines against Arab 
infiltration and detecting and running down terrorists. It works closely
 with the Army and patrols the Administered Territories and the border 
area. The Border Guard also trains settlers in defense measures against 
infiltrators, and schedules guard duty in border villages. Military 
conscripts who elect to fulfill their term of service by joining the 
Border guard are the principal sources of new recruits for this 
component. The Border Guard, which number about 6,000, is integrated 
into the Army in time of war.

</p><p>The effective strength of the police force (not including the 
Border Guard) reached about 12,000 at the end of 1969. Roughly 1,100 of 
the police, including 768 Arabs, were employed in the Administered 
Territories in 1969. Over half of the police force are Jews of Oriental 
background and, in fact, the police force is a branch of government to 
which the assignment of Oriental Jews has been particularly encouraged.

</p><p>The police force is capable of maintaining public order and 
safety under normal circumstances. It has, however, been troubled by a 
manpower shortage caused by resignations resulting from low pay, 
overwork and the attraction of higher paying jobs elsewhere. Despite the
 persistent shortage of manpower, police discipline is generally 
satisfactory and, in the case of the Border Guard, excellent. The public
 attitude toward the police has improved since the early days of 
statehood, despite scandals involving smuggling and the acceptance of 
bribes. The police force has worked hard to overcome the traditional 
Jewish fear of police authority stemming from the historic oppression of
 Jews. The Israeli Police Force in effect acts as a very important 
auxiliary to Shin Beth in the preservation of internal security 
throughout the country. The police support Shin Beth in investigations, 
by providing cover and making arrests.

<a name="36"></a></p><h3>G. Key Officials</h3>

<p><b>Achi-Tuv, Avraham</b>

</p><p>Achi-Tuv became Director of Shin Beth in the summer of 1974. He 
is a career security officer. His reputation was established as chief of
 Shin Beth's Arab Affairs Department, where he was responsible for 
conducting operations in the Administered Territories and within the 
Arab community in Israel. He served briefly as Deputy Director of Shin 
Beth prior to his appointment as Director. Achi-Tuv is of German 
background. He is married and has a daughter. He earned a law degree at 
the University of Tel Aviv in the early 1970s while serving in Shin 
Beth. He is extremely bright, hard-working, ambitious and thorough. He 
is also known to be headstrong, abrasive and arrogant.

</p><p><b>Hoffi, Yitzhak</b>

</p><p>Major General (Ret.) Yitzak Hoffi became Director of Mossad on 1 
September 1974. He was born in Tel Aviv on 25 January 1927. He joined 
the Haganah in 1944 and commanded a company in the Arab-Israeli War in 
1948. He continued to serve in the Israeli Defense Forces in a variety 
of command, staff and training posts, including the command of the 
Paratroop Brigade. Hoffi was Acting Chief of Staff for a brief period in
 April 1974, but retired from the IDF at that time, apparently because 
he was not appointed Chief of Staff. Hoffi attended the US Army Command 
and General Staff College in the mid-1960s. He has also visited the US 
on many occasions. In 1968 he inspected police units and participated in
 army exercises in Uganda. He traveled as a tourist to Hawaii, Japan, 
Hong Kong, Bangkok and Tehran in 1970 and went to Singapore on 
undisclosed business. He inspected Israeli advisory efforts in Ethiopia 
in 1972 and also went to other parts of Africa. Although not an 
intelligence officer by background or training, Hoffi apparently 
demonstrated his flair for intelligence analysis as Commander of the 
Northern Command in the days preceding the Yom Kippur War in October 
1973 by sensing the impending Syrian attack and requesting the Defense 
Minister to reinforce the Golan Heights with an armored brigade. Hoffi 
reportedly has expanded Mossad's role in the collection of intelligence 
on Arab capabilities and the interpretation of such information.

</p><p>Hoffi is reserved and quiet but can be warm and genial among 
friends. He is married and has two daughters. He speaks English. Neither
 as flashy nor as imaginative as some of his predecessors in Mossad, he 
is reported to be meticulous and somewhat dour.

</p><p><b>Sagi, Yehoshua</b>

</p><p>General Yehoshua Sagi, born 27 September 1933, Jerusalem, 
Palestine (Israel), entered the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) in 1951 and 
was commissioned in 1953. &gt;From 1953 to 1964 he served in the 
Southern Command, fulfilling field duties. During the Sinai Campaign he 
served as an intelligence officer with the 7th Brigade and later as an 
assistant intelligence officer, Southern Command. In 1965 he graduated 
from the IDF Command and Staff College. Following his graduation he 
served as commander of an Intelligence Officer Training Course, and as 
an intelligence officer with the Southern Command before returning in 
1971 as an instructor with the Command and Staff College. In 1972 he 
became commander of the Intelligence School but left in 1973 to become 
intelligence officer with the Armored Division, Southern Command. On 19 
May 1974 Sagi was appointed Deputy Director, Military Intelligence, 
Production and Estimates. On 2 February 1979 he assumed the Directorship
 of Military Intelligence. Sagi is soft-spoken, direct and has a 
no-nonsense outlook. He considers himself an Arab expert. He is married 
and has three daughters. He speaks English.

A number of Israeli officials have reacted sharply to the <i>Washington Post</i> and <i>Boston Globe</i>
 articles on this document. A&nbsp;government spokesperson called the 
reports on Israeli operations against the United States "ridiculous, not
 worthy of comment." Intelligence sources quoted in Israeli papers said 
the CIA document was a Soviet disinformation effort. The <i>Jerusalem Post</i>,
 quoting unnamed Israeli and American sources, stated that the U.S. had 
conducted operations against Israel similar to those the document says 
Israel conducted against the U.S.</p><p>
The most reliable response to the <i>Post</i> and <i>Globe</i> articles came from former Mossad chief Isser Harel, who in a <i>Ma'ariv</i>
 interview called the assertions of the document "malicious," 
"dilletantish," "distortions ... but probably authentic." "The report is
 one-sided and malicious, it ignores Israel's special position in its 
struggle for survival," Harel said. He also complained about the CIA 
document's style, calling it anti-Semitic. He told <i>Ma'ariv</i> it was
 "shockingly irresponsible" for the CIA to keep a document like this 
"rolling around" in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Altogether, Harel 
concluded, publication of the document had been a "nightmare" for him.

<blockquote><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
 the shelves of a few libraries around the country — and undoubtedly 
also in the archives of the KGB — is a remarkable collection of books 
entitled "Documents from the U.S. Espionage Den." These flimsy paperback
 volumes, now 68 in all, contain the raw CIA and State Department cables
 seized by Iranian militants when they overran the U.S. Embassy in 
Tehran in 1979. The most sensitive CIA cables had been shredded into 
confetti by the embassy staff, only to be reconstructed, strip by strip,
 by the industrious Iranians.</font></blockquote><p>
