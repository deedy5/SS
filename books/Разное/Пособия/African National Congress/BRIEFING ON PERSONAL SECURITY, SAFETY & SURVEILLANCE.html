<h4>1. <a name="PERSONAL">PERSONAL</a> SECURITY and SAFETY</h4>
<p>This section contains advice on precautionary measures that should be taken
by all members in order to prevent personal attack, avoid surveillance and
protect information in their possession. The precautions needed to be taken by
any individual will depend greatly on the assessed threat to that individual.
This can be ascertained by taking into consideration such things as position in
the Movement, profile, work tasks, contacts, enemy threats and so forth.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it is impossible for anyone to take all the measures
mentioned here or to remain on 'red alert' for twenty-four hours a day.
Precautions have to be geared to the possibility of attack or the likelihood of
surveillance. For example, most people are relatively vulnerable when entering
or leaving their homes, approaching their work places, or at other times when
their movements can be anticipated. It is at such times that a high degree of
alertness is required.</p>
<p>Vulnerability means openness to successful attack. It is therefore important
to learn to recognise a vulnerable situation when it presents itself, and
although in practice you may not always be able to avoid it, you should always
be prepared to meet it. In this way you, and those around you, will never be
taken entirely by surprise.</p>
<p><b>General</b></p>
<p>Alertness and vigilance are our primary defences against enemy attack. A
person who is awake and observant is less likely to fall victim to enemy
machinations than someone who is oblivious to their surroundings and wrapped up
in their own existence. Being alert is not just a matter of keeping our wits
about us but of keeping a balanced state of mind. Paranoid imaginings that the
enemy lurks behind every bush and knows our every move can be as dangerous as
heedlessness.</p>
<p>Everyone should at least observe these most general precautions; those who
feel they are more at risk should read on:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Be alert to suspicious or unaccountable conduct by persons around you or
    in the vicinity of your home or place of work.</li>
  <li>Be sensitive to areas of threat or controversy arising from your normal
    activities or personal circumstances and inform those of your comrades,
    family and friends who should be aware of the situation.</li>
  <li>Remember that an attack will only succeed if you are caught unawares. A
    potential attacker who can see that you and your family, friends and
    comrades are on guard will be forced to stop and think, however briefly,
    thereby increasing your chances of taking evasive action or summoning
    assistance.</li>
  <li>Summon assistance at the first sign that something unusual has happened or
    is about to happen. Call for help or sound an alarm. If you are unable to do
    this for yourself, your family, friends and comrades should be prepared to
    raise the alarm on their own initiative at the first sign that anything is
    amiss.</li>
  <li>Raising an alarm or displaying firmness can of themselves effectively
    deter potential attackers from continuing their attack.</li>
  <li>Those close to you may at any time feature in the plans of potential
    attackers and in general these measures should be regarded as equally
    applicable to them.</li>
  <li>Knowledge of your movements and activities should be strictly limited to
    yourself and those who need to know. The enemy can only work out plans of
    attack if they can predict your moves.</li>
  <li>Keep yourself in a fit state of mind to enable you to respond quickly to
    threatening situations. Drunkenness and inward thinking can cost lives.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Routine</b></p>
<p>Routine and predictability are our greatest enemies - they enable hostile
parties to anticipate our next moves. Always ask yourself: 'Am I following a set
routine?'; 'Can anyone predict what I am going to do next?'</p>
<ol>
  <li>Avoid establishing observable patterns of behaviour which would enable the
    enemy to predict your future movements, construct a plan around them,
    intercept you in conditions unfavourable to you and isolate you from
    effective assistance.</li>
  <li>Do not regularly use the same eating and drinking places where people
    might readily expect to find you.</li>
  <li>Do not regularly use the same hotels and shops, places of entertainment,
    recreation and study etc.</li>
  <li>Do not regularly meet people in the same places or at the same times.</li>
  <li>Avoid using the same routes to and from places that you regularly visit,
    such as work and friends.</li>
  <li>Do not regularly catch buses from the same stop; trains from the same
    station. Similarly, do not regularly get off buses and trains at the same
    stops or stations.</li>
  <li>Try not to regularly use the same bus routes or train lines. You can often
    get to the same place by using other routes and lines. It might require more
    effort or take longer, but it's worth it.</li>
</ol>
<h4>MOVEMENT, TRAVEL AND TRANSPORT</h4>
<p><b>General:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Never disclose details of your movements to anyone to whom it is not
    essential that you do so.</li>
  <li>Whenever you are going somewhere for any length of time make sure that
    someone responsible at home or your work knows:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>where you are going;</li>
      <li>whom you are going to see;</li>
      <li>how and by which route you will travel;</li>
      <li>when you are due to arrive;</li>
      <li>when you are due to return.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>AND they should know what to do if something should go wrong.</p></li>
  <li>Never make public your travel arrangements. Try not to announce your
    travel plans over the phone or in letters. When making bookings be sure that
    no one overhears you, or ask for a destination which is closer to or beyond
    your actual one.</li>
  <li>If the risk warrants it, make advance reservations for travel and
    accommodation in a different name.</li>
  <li>Always change your routes and times of departure and arrival when making
    regular journeys.</li>
  <li>Make a habit of checking the road or area in front of your home or place
    of work before leaving to see if there are any suspicious persons or strange
    vehicles in the vicinity. To make this easier, become familiar with your
    environment and try to memorise what vehicles are normally parked outside
    the places where you live and work.</li>
  <li>If possible, travel in company - especially at night.</li>
  <li>Make a habit of checking that everything appears normal each time you
    begin and end a journey. Ask yourself: 'Is there anything to suggest that
    something has changed or that the enemy has taken control during my
    absence?'</li>
  <li>Endeavour to be as inconspicuous as possible when travelling in public. Do
    not wear bright clothing; bags and hats also help tails and attackers to
    keep on your track.</li>
  <li>If you are carrying something valuable do not let it out of your grip.
    Briefcases may be secured to your wrist with a strap or chain; straps of
    bags should be placed over your head and not just over a shoulder. Let bags
    hang in front of you but still be careful of pickpockets in crowded
    situations. Do not use open bags or baskets: make it difficult for thieves
    to remove important objects.</li>
  <li>Very important documents and large quantities of money should not be
    carried in a case or bag. Place them in an inside pocket or conceal them
    under your clothes where they cannot fall out.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Walking:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Always walk with your head up and scan repeatedly with your eyes from the
    distance towards yourself. Your natural focal point should be the distance,
    not your feet. Do not daydream; concentrate and remain alert.</li>
  <li>In countries where cars drive the left, walk on the right-hand side of the
    road. This allows you to see approaching cars and it makes it more difficult
    for a car following you to intercept you, as it has to cut across the
    oncoming traffic.</li>
  <li>Walk near the kerb or in the middle of the road when it is dark. Keep well
    away from poorly lit areas, shrubbery, dark doorways or other places of
    concealment.</li>
  <li>Avoid short cuts through vacant lots, deserted parks and unlit alleys.
    Always try to walk where you, and an assailant, would be seen by members of
    the public.</li>
  <li>Avoid situations without escape routes; choose routes which offer obvious
    and multiple paths of flight.</li>
  <li>Always remember that there is as much space behind you as in front of you.
    Try to remain aware of what is going on behind as much as in front.</li>
  <li>Never walk from one place to another along the most direct and obvious
    route. Walking in an unpredictable way makes it difficult for a pursuing
    attacker or tail to guess your next moves.</li>
  <li>Never read anything while walking; avoid animated conversations if walking
    with someone.</li>
  <li>Never accept lifts from strangers.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Private transport:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Have your rear-view mirrors well adjusted and clean - AND USE THEM.</li>
  <li>Keep your vehicle in good working order; keep it clean and tidy inside.
    Remove all articles that could be booby-trapped.</li>
  <li>If you have a garage use it at all times. Ensure that the garage has a
    good lock and that other entry points are secure.</li>
  <li>If you park your car outside your home try to park it in a position in
    which it can be seen from your house or where it will be in view of
    neighbours or passers-by.</li>
  <li>Try not to park your car for long periods in places where the enemy would
    have the opportunity to tamper with it or booby-trap it without anyone
    seeing.</li>
  <li>Ensure that your car is locked and that the windows are up whenever you
    park. Do not leave valuables in view: put them in the boot.</li>
  <li>If you suspect a tail, make certain by circulating a block, driving in an
    erratic way or doing something irrational or 'illegal' like placing yourself
    in the wrong lane or going through a red traffic light. (<i>For more
    information on protection of private transport see <a href="#CAR">Section 4
    - Car bombs</a></i>.)</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Public transport:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>When using buses and trains, always seat yourself in a position where you
    have a good view of other passengers getting on and off.</li>
  <li>Try not to travel when it is very late or early. Waiting on deserted
    platforms or in dark streets can be dangerous.</li>
  <li>When travelling by train avoid empty carriages and compartments.</li>
  <li>If you have important luggage always try to keep it with you - and keep
    your eye on it. If it is too large to have with you then sit or stand near
    it so that you can keep it in view all the time. If you have to surrender
    your luggage make sure that it is well locked and identifiable. Before
    opening it on return make sure that it has not been tampered with.</li>
  <li>If travelling by bus and you suspect that you are being tailed, get off
    beyond your destination and walk back. If the suspected tail gets off with
    you you can take evasive action or avoid going to the destination; if not,
    the tail will get off at the next stop and walk back toward your stop, by
    which time you will be well away. If you had got off before your destination
    you would be walking in the direction of the next stop and might bump into
    the tail.</li>
  <li>If travelling by train and you suspect that you are being tailed get onto
    a train going in the opposite direction and then cross over at the next
    station; or go beyond your destination and catch a train back. If the
    suspected tail does the same it will be a give-away.</li>
  <li>When using taxis announce your destination after you have entered it. If
    this is not possible then ask for an incorrect destination and then 'change
    your mind' when you are inside.</li>
  <li>Do not phone for a taxi from your home: the enemy could be eavesdropping
    and send their own 'taxi'. Do not give the correct name when phoning for a
    taxi and do not give the exact destination.</li>
  <li>If your destination is secret do not get a taxi to drop you directly
    outside the place. Get out some distance away and then walk to your
    destination, keeping an eye out for tails.</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. <a name="HOUSEHOLD">HOUSEHOLD</a> SECURITY</h3>
<p>For most of us we are at our most vulnerable when approaching or leaving our
homes. This does not mean, however, that when we are inside our homes we are
safe. The enemy knows that our homes are the one place where they will most
definitely find us, at one time or another, and that when we are at home we are
likely to be off our guard. Our homes may also contain information and equipment
that is of interest to the enemy and which could jeopardise the safety of our
comrades should it fall into their hands.</p>
<p><b>Physical aspects:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Fit mortise dead-locks to all outer doors. Exterior doors should be of
    sturdy construction but make sure that they are fitted to equally sturdy
    door frames. Glazed doors should be fitted with burglar bars and obscured
    with blinds or curtains.</li>
  <li>Know where all keys for your outer doors are. If you cannot account for
    them all - CHANGE THE LOCK.</li>
  <li>Fit strong door chains to outer doors - AND USE THEM.</li>
  <li>If your residence is above ground or if you have no view of your front
    door fit an entry-phone and electrically-operated door release.
    Alternatively fit an optical viewer to enable you to see visitors before
    opening.</li>
  <li>Fit window locks on ground-floor windows and to any upper floors to which
    access can easily be obtained, especially those hidden from the view of
    neighbours and passers-by. Any opening windows not normally used can be
    permanently screwed to the frame.</li>
  <li>Fit burglar bars to accessible windows that are hidden from the view of
    neighbours and passers-by.</li>
  <li>Hang heavy curtains in those rooms most regularly used and see that they
    are drawn as soon as it gets dark. Use net curtains on windows that allow an
    easy view into regularly used rooms.</li>
  <li>Light the approach to your house with exterior lights placed out of reach.
    See that this lighting is regularly used and maintained.</li>
  <li>Leave a 'courtesy' light burning in the area of the front door during the
    hours of darkness.</li>
  <li>Consider the use of other forms of security lighting for use in
    emergencies or when suspicion is aroused. Floodlights placed in strategic
    points make it difficult for would-be assailants to escape without detection
    or to hide in the shadows.</li>
  <li>Always have reserve lighting to hand, such as torches, paraffin lamps and
    candles.</li>
  <li>Depending on the assessed degree of threat, consider installing a burglar
    alarm system in your house, and in your garage if you have one. Boundary
    fencing which makes access to your property difficult for intruders can also
    be installed. There are boundary alarm systems that can be fitted to warn of
    penetration.</li>
  <li>In the absence of peripheral alarm systems, encourage the growth of trees
    and hedges near your boundary which hinder access to your property. Keep
    fences in good repair. Try to block the view from the street into rooms
    which are most often used.</li>
  <li>Remove and trim shrubs near your house, particularly near paths and
    driveways, to make concealment of attackers and devices difficult.</li>
  <li>Always keep at least one approved fire extinguisher in an easily
    accessible place.</li>
  <li>Ensure that there is an easily accessible fire escape, about which your
    family should know and which should be obvious to visitors.</li>
  <li>Fit a doorbell if you do not have one and make sure that it is working at
    all times.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Practical aspects:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Never answer the door automatically - always check who is there first.
    Demand to know who it is before opening, or look through a window if you
    have a view of the door.</li>
  <li>If you have an answer-phone do not press the door release if you do not
    know the person or recognise the voice. Even if you know the name, do not
    press the release button until you are certain that the caller really is who
    she/he says she/he is.</li>
  <li>Do not open a door if at all suspicious of the caller. Demand identity
    cards from anyone who needs access to your home, such as meter readers or
    workpeople, and watch them while they do their work.</li>
  <li>Encourage friends, relatives and comrades to inform you of intended
    visits.</li>
  <li>Treat late callers, whether known or unknown, with great suspicion.</li>
  <li>Use the door chain if one is fitted, but always prepare yourself for an
    intruder.</li>
  <li>Never leave a key under the doormat, in the mail-box or other obvious
    place.</li>
  <li>Know exactly how many keys you have for your house and know where they are
    or who has them at all times. Do not issue spare keys to too many people or
    to people you do not know well.</li>
  <li>Never announce on the phone or write in a letter where you might leave a
    key, even if the hiding place is a good one.</li>
  <li>Never leave keys with neighbours unless you know that you can trust them
    completely.</li>
  <li>Never leave keys with workpeople who might be working on your home when
    you go out. Never leave your home while workpeople are working on your home
    - they may be enemy agents.</li>
  <li>Never leave your keys in a position where someone could steal or take an
    impression of them, such as in the pocket of a coat you might hang up in a
    changing room or restaurant.</li>
  <li>If your keys are stolen or if you lose them change the locks of outer
    doors immediately.</li>
  <li>Make a safety check each night before retiring to ensure that all external
    doors and windows are locked.</li>
  <li>Always lock all external doors and windows before you leave the house,
    even if you are only going out for a few minutes. Include accessible
    upstairs windows.</li>
  <li>Always leave a light burning in a front room when you are out at night.
    Time switches can be fitted to turn lights on and off at random or certain
    times.</li>
  <li>Never leave a garage door open when you go out in a car: it suggests the
    house may be empty and the garage may contain tools useful to someone trying
    to gain access.</li>
  <li>When your house will be unoccupied for any length of time try not to allow
    this to become public knowledge. Best is to have a trusted friend or
    relative occupy it while you are away.</li>
  <li>Before leaving your house unoccupied for any length of time make sure that
    all regular deliveries are cancelled: their continued arrival will signal
    that the house is unoccupied. Get a trusted friend or neighbour to check
    your premises daily and to remove any signs that would indicate that it is
    unoccupied.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Sensitive materials in our homes:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Keep your home tidy so that sensitive materials cannot get lost under
    junk.</li>
  <li>Keep all sensitive materials under lock and key - preferably in lockable
    filing cabinets or in a safe. But remember, the first thing an intruder will
    look for is a keep that is obviously intended to prevent theft. Ideally make
    or have made a secret compartment that will hold your most sensitive
    materials. A thief who raids a locked filing cabinet or safe might believe
    that he or she has found your most important documents or objects and look
    no further.</li>
  <li>When working with sensitive materials take out of your compartment the
    minimum that you need to get on with the job. Situations always arise where
    an unexpected visitor arrives or you have to leave suddenly. Never leave out
    of your compartment anything that you would normally keep in it, even if you
    go out just for a few minutes.</li>
  <li>If you go away for any length of time leave some sign in your compartment
    or in the room where it is located to indicate if it has been opened and/or
    gone through.</li>
  <li>Regularly go through your sensitive materials and ask yourself: 'Do I
    really need this?' Keep only what you really need to carry out your work.</li>
  <li>Do not discard in a bin sensitive materials that you no longer want - the
    enemy can find them there. Destroy completely materials that you no longer
    need. Documents can either be burnt or flushed down a toilet, other
    materials should be burnt or buried. When burning make sure that your fire
    is hot so that all traces are destroyed; before flushing papers down a
    toilet saturate them with water and tear them into shreds.</li>
  <li>Ultra-sensitive information, such as names and addresses, should ideally
    be kept separate from your main store of sensitive materials. Preferably get
    someone you trust but who is not connected with your work to keep them.
    Consider keeping very important information on a computer and/or encrypting
    it.</li>
  <li>Never take with you more sensitive material than you will need; check each
    time you return that everything you no longer need is returned to the
    compartment or safe.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Children:</b></p>
<p>Our children might feature in the plans of attackers but of more importance
is the fact that without proper discipline they might unwittingly endanger
others.</p>
<ol>
  <li>At all times keep young children within sight or earshot, or place them in
    the care of responsible and trustworthy adults.</li>
  <li>Use only baby-sitters in whom you have complete trust. They should be
    instructed what to say should the phone ring or if someone should come to
    the door.</li>
  <li>Never allow young children to travel to school, friends or other places
    unaccompanied by an adult.</li>
  <li>Instruct your children to tell you where and with whom they will be when
    away from home.</li>
  <li>Warn your children, of all ages, not to speak to or accept lifts from
    strangers. The enemy might attempt to acquire information about you through
    your children.</li>
  <li>Instruct children never to admit strangers to your home.</li>
  <li>Discourage your children from answering doors and forbid them to do so
    during the hours of darkness.</li>
  <li>Do not allow younger members of your family to open your mail.</li>
  <li>Forbid younger children from answering the phone as they may
    unintentionally give out information which may be detrimental to you. Older
    children must be instructed not to talk about you.</li>
  <li>Do not discuss with your children or in their presence matters about which
    they should not or do not need to know. However, excessive secrecy can lead
    to curiosity and interference with your affairs.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. <a name="SURVEILLANCE">SURVEILLANCE</a></h3>
<p>Many of us believe ourselves to be under surveillance. While undoubtedly some
of us are, it is important not to allow ourselves to suffer from a persecution
complex - believing that our every word and move is the object of enemy
attention. If we do we will put the brakes on our activity and nothing will get
done: the enemy has achieved its objective.</p>
<p>To keep someone under permanent surveillance is a time- consuming and
labour-intensive business. To do the job properly the enemy has to allocate a
team of people who have to be equipped with vehicles, radios and the other
paraphernalia of surveillance and eavesdropping. Not only that, there have to be
people to listen to, transcribe and interpret all intercepted conversations.</p>
<p><b>Telephones</b></p>
<p>The telephone is a service provided by the state and as such it gives the
providing authority a direct listening channel into our homes and places of
work. There is little that we can do to prevent it being used to eavesdrop on
our private conversations and for this reason our best defence against it is not
a technical but a political one.</p>
<p>There are three basic ways that the telephone can be used to eavesdrop:</p>
<ol>
  <li>it can be used to monitor actual two-way telephone conversations;</li>
  <li>it can be used to monitor non-telephonic conversations in a room or
    building;</li>
  <li>it can be used as a power source to run other electronic eavesdropping
    devices.</li>
</ol>
<p>Telephone taps are either official or unofficial. The former are those
undertaken by the controlling authority and have to be approved by the
government where the tapping is taking place. The latter are those undertaken by
anyone who wishes to listen to the conversations of another without official
approval. In the case of our membership there may be some official taps in place
but it is far more probable that most taps will be unofficial - that is, taps
carried out by our main enemy in environments which they do not control. This is
not to say that there is no collaboration between the authorities in the
countries in which our members reside, and our real enemy.</p>
<p><b>1. Telephone conversations:</b></p>
<p>There are a multitude of ways that a telephone can be bugged. Conversations
can be tapped at any point from the telephone handpiece (receiver) all the way
to the telephone exchange. The tapped conversation may in addition be relayed by
a number of different methods or be recorded directly onto tape.</p>
<p>Starting from the handpiece, the microphone in the mouthpiece can be replaced
by a radio microphone of exactly the same appearance as the original one. This
will transmit both sides of a telephone conversation to a radio receiver a short
distance away. A recording can be made of the received signal.</p>
<p>Various transmitting devices can be fitted inside the body of the phone, in
the wall-socket and inside junction boxes. Similar transmitting devices can be
fitted to the line at any point up to the exchange. Some of these can be
exceedingly small but then they are exceedingly weak. Most are powered by the
current in the phone line so do not need constant replacing of batteries.
Certain short-life devices are powered by their own batteries but these would
only be used on one-off occasions which the enemy would want to monitor or where
an enemy agent can easily gain access to the device.</p>
<p>The best telephone monitoring devices are those which are hard-wired to the
line. The tapping usually takes place at a junction box where a spare pair of
wires in the eavesdropper's line (this may be a neighbour or someone in an
office in the same building) is attached to your pair. This leads your signal
off to wherever a tape recorder can safely be located. Each time you pick up
your handpiece the recorder will be activated and every word of your
conversation will be recorded. When there is an official tap on your line it is
done in this way except that the tapping is done at a special station which has
a direct line to your local exchange.</p>
<p><b>2. Non-telephone conversations:</b></p>
<p>There are a number of ways that a telephone can be kept 'alive' or 'off-hook'
so that conversations picked up with a microphone can be be fed into the
telephone line. A microphone can be connected to the line at any point (the
wires to the microphone can be any length so the microphone itself need not
necessarily be near the line) or the phone's own microphone can be used to pick
up conversations in a room. This means that conversations in a room can be
listened to from anywhere in the world, not just along the connection to the
local exchange.</p>
<p><b>3. The telephone as a power source:</b></p>
<p>As there is a voltage in the phone line it can be used in the same way as the
mains to power eavesdropping devices. Thus all manner of bugging devices can be
attached to the phone line to transmit both telephone conversations and ordinary
conversations in the room where the microphone of the device is located.</p>
<p><b>What to do about it:</b></p>
<p>The best advice that can be given about preventing telephone eavesdropping
is: DON'T USE IT. The telephone is a very dangerous instrument and not a few of
our most important secrets have got into the hands of the enemy this way.</p>
<p>We have to be very strict with ourselves about using the telephone. Over many
years we have grown dependent on it and in some situations it requires great
effort to convey messages by other methods. If you have no choice but to use the
telephone then at least cultivate a correct attitude about using it and take
elementary precautions to disguise information:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Always assume that there are the three parties involved in every phone
    call you make: you, the person you have called and the enemy.</li>
  <li>Before making an important phone call always ask yourself: 'Is there not
    another way that I can get this information to the other person?' Don't opt
    for the telephone just because it's 'too much bother' to do it another way.
    Better later but safe.</li>
  <li>Always use an agreed code language when talking about important matters.
    This should also contain a method of indicating dates and times. However, it
    must be remembered that to an eavesdropper it is obvious when a code is
    being used so don't believe that you are safe when you use one. The code
    itself indicates that you have something important to hide.</li>
  <li>Keep important calls as short as possible. The less you say the better.</li>
  <li>As far as possible try to use public telephones for making important
    calls. But do not always use the same callbox - that could be as bad as
    using your own phone! Also, there is not much point in using a public phone
    if you suspect that the other person's phone might also be tapped.</li>
  <li>Always ask yourself after you have made a call: 'Did I say anything that
    could be of use to the enemy? Did I say anything that could be added to what
    I have said before?'</li>
</ol>
<p>It is almost impossible to be certain that your phone is not tapped as the
tap could be an official one. However, it may be possible to detect unofficial
taps and there are a number of measures that can be taken to defeat them and
other forms of bugging using the phone line.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Always remove the telephone instrument from the room in which you are
    having an important conversation. However, this does not mean that you are
    safe as a separate microphone attached to the phone line could still be
    picking up and relaying your conversations.</li>
  <li>If you suspect a bug inside the body of your phone then open it and have a
    look. There should be nothing inside apart from what is obviously attached
    to the circuit board. If you are still uncertain then buy a new phone - they
    are very cheap these days!</li>
  <li>Open the phone socket and check for microphones and bugs. There should
    either be nothing or if there is a small circuit board then no more than one
    or two small components obviously fixed to it.</li>
  <li>Follow your phone line all the way to the junction box from where it feeds
    to the street. There should be nothing attached to it, no lines branching
    off it and at the junction box there should be no more than a pair of wires
    connected to the street side of the connector to which your pair are
    attached. If there are connections it could indicate that your line is
    taking a deviation to a recording post nearby.</li>
  <li>Whenever you get a wrong number always lift the receiver a few seconds
    after you have put it down. This will turn off 'keep-alive' bugs which are
    activated when the false caller calls.</li>
  <li>If you are still worried about phone bugs then take the precautions
    mentioned in the next section on 'bugs'.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>'BUGS'</b></p>
<p>The term 'bug' is usually used to refer to small radio microphones, but these
are not the only type. There are a great variety of radio bugs but most work by
capturing a conversation with a microphone and then relaying it by air to a
receiver situated some distance away. It is important to realise that for every
bug there must be a receiver, as well as either someone listening to the
receiver with a pair of earphones or a tape recorder recording the received
signal. Thus it is impossible for there to be a bug in every room of all our
houses, or even every room of the house of someone important.</p>
<p>Bugs are either powered by available permanent power sources such as the
mains or the phone line, or by battery. This has a bearing on the nature of the
bug. Mains-powered bugs can be placed or disguised in permanent fixtures while
battery-powered bugs have to be accessible for battery replacement. Thus
mains-powered bugs are usually used where the surveillance is intended to be
permanent or long-term and battery-powered bugs where the surveillance is
one-off or short-term.</p>
<p>Mains-powered bugs are generally more powerful as they have an endless and
large source of power. They may be disguised in sockets, switches, adaptors,
fixtures, lamps, appliances or any other device that plugs into or can be
connected to the mains.</p>
<p>The mains itself can be bugged in much the same way as the phone line and
anyone connected to the same circuit can listen to a conversation in a bugged
room by connecting their receiving unit to the circuit. The captured signal is
carried through the mains wires without being broadcast.</p>
<p>Battery-powered bugs are usually planted out of sight in a room where it is
known that an important conversation is to take place shortly before the event.
Unless the planters of the bug have someone who can without suspicion gain
access to the bug to service it (i.e. a 'mole' or 'plant'), the bug is discarded
or retrieved after the event.</p>
<p><b>What to do about bugs:</b></p>
<p>The most important defence against bugs is adopting a correct attitude to
them. There cannot be bugs everywhere as each one means that someone has to
listen to and transcribe everything that is said in its presence. This means
tying down a vast workforce and the use of large quantities of expensive
surveillance equipment for possibly little gain.</p>
<p>If there are not bugs everywhere then there are bugs where it is going to be
profitable for the enemy to plant them. Our defence is to not allow situations
to arise where it becomes profitable for the enemy to do this. This means being
very disciplined about where important meetings and conversations take place.
Meetings held regularly in easily accessible places mean bugged meetings.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Never announce out load at important meetings when and where your next
    meeting is to be held. If the meeting is bugged the enemy will know when and
    where to place the next bug.</li>
  <li>Never talk on the phone about the times and places of important meetings.
    You could give the enemy warning.</li>
  <li>Never send in the post notification of important meetings. You will give
    the enemy advance notice.</li>
  <li>Never hold important meetings regularly in the same place. A bug will be
    planted as a permanent fixture.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you suspect that a room in which you intend to have a meeting is bugged
there is no substitute for a good physical search for the bug. While it is
possible to purchase special instruments that can detect the presence of bugs,
these can never discover all known types and thus give a false sense of
security. In addition an improper understanding of how bugs work will make it
difficult to interpret what the bug detector is saying.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open all wall sockets and switches to look for hidden bugs.</li>
  <li>Pull forward all furniture against the wall and look behind it, under it,
    under any shelves and in compartments etc.</li>
  <li>Inspect any immovable fixtures. Especially look under low shelves and
    behind heaters etc.</li>
  <li>Investigate any unaccountable wires running through the room. Every wire
    must have a source and ending; otherwise remove it.</li>
  <li>Look behind any pictures or other fixtures to the walls. In addition
    inspect skirtings and rails for holes which might conceal microphones.</li>
  <li>Inspect all items in the room that could conceal a bug. Bugs can be
    concealed in virtually anything - suppliers sell them hidden in light bulbs,
    calculators, cigarette lighters, ornaments, lamps, adaptors, pens, cigarette
    holders, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even after a physical search has been conducted and nothing found, a
participant in the meeting could bring a bug into the room. Perhaps
consideration should be given to physical searches of people and items in their
possession such as briefcases and bags. In addition the following practices
should always be adopted even if nothing is revealed through a search:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Do not hold important meetings in rooms where the enemy might expect you
    to meet. For instance, in private residences do not meet in living rooms;
    meet in bedrooms, the bathroom, the kitchen, outrooms or even the toilet.</li>
  <li>Shift furniture against the outer walls of rooms in which you meet and
    then sit in a huddle in the empty part of the room.</li>
  <li>Place a sound source behind yourselves such that it is between you and
    suspected bugs in the furniture and/or in the peripheral parts of the room
    (eg. walls). Best is to use pre-recorded speech and to play several
    recordings in different parts of the room. Music does not effectively
    obliterate speech and can in any case be filtered off from a recording
    because it is usually of a higher frequency than speech. Direct speech from
    the radio and TV can be recorded by the enemy and used to eliminate the same
    from a recording they make of your meeting. Do not have the volume of the
    sound source too loud as this will force you to raise your voices.</li>
  <li>As far as possible write the most important parts of your conversation and
    show it to the other participants. Never say out aloud the names of people
    who might be compromised by your doing so or mention addresses, important
    dates, projects etc.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>MICROPHONES:</b></p>
<p>Microphones are used in situations where it is not practical to use bugs,
such as outdoors. Microphones are also used in situations which are controlled
by the enemy (e.g.. hotels) and where the enemy can get close access (e.g.. next
door).</p>
<p>Directional microphones and parabolic reflectors are used outdoors to pick up
conversations from afar. The defence against them is to have a loud source of
noise in the background (e.g.. traffic) or to keep changing your position or
direction of movement.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of specialised microphones for use in special
situations. For instance there are 'keyhole' microphones for listening through
cracks and small holes in walls of adjacent rooms, 'contact' microphones for
listening through thin partitions and windows, 'laser' microphones for picking
up the vibrations of speech on window panes. The defence against microphones
generally are the same as those for bugs.</p>
<h3>4. <a name="CAR">CAR</a> BOMBS</h3>
<p>The booby-trapping of vehicles is a method of attacking our members which has
been resorted to by our enemies in the past and could still be used in the
future. It is a particularly pernicious method of attack because car-bombs are
difficult to detect and they can be effective in achieving their objective.</p>
<p><b>Types of car bombs:</b></p>
<p>The various types of car bombs are distinguished by the ways that they are
detonated. There is an almost infinite variety of methods of detonation due to
the complexity of vehicles and the range of physical actions and processes that
take place when a vehicle is in operation. Bombs can be rigged to function in a
vehicle by pressure, pressure-release, pull, push, tilt, acceleration, braking,
motion, velocity, electrical, chemical, thermal and barometric activating
systems. In addition, a bomb can be placed in a vehicle and detonated by various
detonating systems independent of the vehicle. A timing device set to fire the
bomb at a time when it is known that the target person will be in or near the
vehicle can just as well be used. Remote firing methods such as concealed wires
and radio control can also be used.</p>
<p>The table at the end of this section indicates some of the places where bombs
could be located and the methods that would be used to detonate them. There are
four basic areas where a bomb can be placed in a vehicle:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>the engine compartment;</li>
  <li>the outer bodywork, including the underneath of the vehicle;</li>
  <li>the passenger compartment;</li>
  <li>the boot. What should be borne in mind, however, is that a car-bomb
    consists of two essential components - an explosive charge and a triggering
    mechanism - and that these are not necessarily together in one of these four
    areas.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>A. Engine compartment:</b></p>
<p>Bombs placed in the engine compartment are usually wired to the ignition coil
or starter so that they explode as soon as the ignition key is turned. However,
they could be wired to any electrical point and be detonated by any switching
action of the bomb-placer's choice. For instance, the bomb could be detonated by
switching on the lights, pressing the hooter, turning on the wipers, pressing
the windscreen washer, pressing the brakes, turning on the radio etc.</p>
<p>Apart from direct connection to the car's electrical circuitry, a bomb can be
detonated by other processes in the engine compartment. A bomb could be attached
to the side of the engine block or to the exhaust manifold and with a thermal
switch be made to explode when the engine reaches a certain temperature.
Virtually any moving part in the engine compartment can be booby-trapped. The
bonnet itself can be fitted with a pressure-release switch to cause a bomb to
explode when it is lifted up. A bomb could even be made to explode when the
accelerator or clutch is depressed.</p>
<p>To achieve maximum effectiveness bombs placed in the engine compartment are
usually placed against the back wall just above the driver's or front
passenger's legs or inside the hump which contains the gearbox or the gear
linkages.</p>
<p><b>B. Outer bodywork:</b></p>
<p>Bombs attached to the outer bodywork may be triggered by any moving part
which could be made to close a switch. For instance, switches connected to the
suspension may either be closed by compression or pressure release. Vehicles
which are front-engined but rear wheel driven have a drive-shaft to which a pull
device may be connected. A switch attached to the steering could be rigged to
close when the steering is turned one way or another or only when a sharp corner
is negotiated. A thermal switch can be attached to the exhaust pipe and set to
explode a bomb when it reaches a certain temperature.</p>
<p>Bombs can be attached to any part of the outer bodywork, under wheel arches
and under the floor pan of the car. Most likely places will be just below seats
and inside wheel arches nearest to where the target passenger or driver is
likely to sit. Such bombs will most likely be held in place by magnets. Remote
controlled devices will need to be attached to fairly exposed places as wires or
radio waves will need to be able to reach them. Such a bomb might even be placed
on the ground under a vehicle.</p>
<p><b>C. Passenger compartment:</b></p>
<p>Inside the passenger compartment a bomb could be triggered by a pressure
switch or mat placed under a seat, seat cover or a carpet. Switches can be
connected to any moving part in the interior, such as the glove box,
cigarette-lighter, ashtray, door and window handles, mirror, switches, dials,
pedals and so on. Common hiding places for the explosive charge inside vehicles
are under seats, behind the dashboard, in vents and in door panels. An
incendiary bomb set to explode when the car is travelling can cause a serious
accident when the interior fills with fire and smoke.</p>
<p><b>D. Boot:</b></p>
<p>In the boot a triggering switch can be attached to the boot lid or any object
in the boot such as the spare tyre or jack. A favourite mounting spot for bombs
is on or near the petrol tank. A simple incendiary bomb mounted on or near a
petrol line can start a fire or even cause an explosion of the tank without the
need for explosives.</p>
<p>A car bomb need not in fact even be mounted in a vehicle. One could be placed
near a vehicle, such as in a garage, and be triggered by the car when the
ignition key is turned or when the car moves off or onto a pressure switch.</p>
<p>Any movement of the vehicle can be used to trigger a bomb. Vibration switches
will fire a bomb as soon as a door is opened or closed; less sensitive ones when
the car hits a pothole. An anemometer (wind-speed measuring meter) can be rigged
to operate a switch when the vehicle reaches a certain speed. Tilt switches can
be made to operate when a corner is taken or when the vehicle is driven up or
down an incline. Accelerometers or simple pendulum switches can be rigged to
close a switch when the car accelerates or brakes. A barometer can be wired to
close a switch when a certain height above sea level is reached, thermostat
switches to operate when a certain temperature is reached and even a mileometer
set to explode after a certain distance is travelled.</p>
<p><b>How to protect against car bombs</b></p>
<p>It is more important to develop a correct attitude toward car bombs than to
know all the possible locations where they can be placed and all the possible
methods by which they may be triggered. This means being constantly vigilant and
trying never to leave an opportunity for the enemy to plant a bomb.</p>
<p>In view of the multitude of places where a bomb can be planted and the
hundreds of methods by which they can be triggered, conducting regular vehicle
searches can be unproductive, and in itself a dangerous practice. Before placing
a bomb the enemy will have done some reconnaissance and if it was noticed that a
search is conducted each day it would be simple to booby-trap some part of the
car, such as the boot or bonnet, which would cause a bomb to explode while the
search is being conducted. A bomb triggered by a vibration switch will be fired
as soon as anything is opened or bumped.</p>
<p>A thorough vehicle search can take hours if done properly. Every moving part
of the car has to be tested by remote methods and every possible location has to
be exposed. This means the doors, bonnet, boot lid, cubby hole etc. have to be
opened; door panels, seats, carpets, hub caps, and so on removed. Even then
there can be no certainty that every possible location has been exposed. A bomb
can be secreted in a number of places where it would not be revealed except by
careful probing. One such place is in the petrol tank, another is inside the
engine.</p>
<p>How then can we protect against car-bombs? The best possible advice is to
ensure that the vehicle is securely locked in a garage when not in use and
guarded at all other times. It can take only a matter of seconds to attach an
explosive device such as a magnetic limpet mine. Since not everyone has a garage
and can have their car guarded while not in use, this is unrealistic for many
people. However, everyone can take a number of steps which will reduce the risks
of bomb placement or at least reduce the number of possible locations where a
bomb can be placed.</p>
<p>Always ensure that when the vehicle is left standing the doors are locked and
the windows properly closed. While it is possible to pick locks, this can be a
difficult and time-consuming task. Locking will reduce the chances of the
passenger compartment being used as a location for the placing of a bomb. The
same applies to the boot. The bonnet of most vehicles can be opened from the
outside despite the fact that most vehicles have a release catch inside the
passenger compartment. To make it more difficult to use the engine compartment
as a bomb placement area, bonnet locks should be fitted. This is important also
for the reason that it will make access to the vehicle's electrics more
difficult. On most vehicles the engine compartment can be reached from
underneath, but if panels are fitted under the engine this area will be removed
from the bomb-placer's options.</p>
<p>Always ensure that the petrol filler cap is locked or fit a lockable cap if
the vehicle does not have one. If the bottom of the vehicle is smooth it might
be possible to fit wooden panels to prevent the attachment of magnetic devices.
A number of other steps like this can be taken to eliminate areas where a bomb
could be placed, but these differ from vehicle to vehicle. Possible locations
should be sought out and filled with something or removed altogether if they are
not vital to the functioning of the vehicle.</p>
<p>The fitting of a vehicle burglar alarm is another valuable safety measure,
but if you do so do not advertise the fact. An alarm which operates on various
areas and not only the passenger compartment is best. And make sure that it is
not one which is easily immobilised. Alarms which protect the under surface of a
vehicle are also available but these are only reliable if the vehicle is parked
in a garage. If the vehicle is kept in a garage it is better to fit the garage
with an alarm rather than the vehicle.</p>
<p>Avoid having any internal or external mascots or unnecessary attachments
which could be booby-trapped or used to hide or disguise some device. Keep the
engine compartment clean and the interior and boot tidy and uncluttered so that
a strange object will be spotted immediately. It is possible for any object,
such as an aerosol can or tin of polish, to be removed and replaced with a
booby-trapped replica. Become familiar with the layout of the engine compartment
and other areas of the vehicle so that a device will be noticed immediately.
Ignorance here can be very dangerous.</p>
<p>If you do carry out a search then do so very carefully. First of all, view
your vehicle from the side and at a distance to see if there are any objects
obviously protruding from the bottom or placed on the ground below it. Without
touching the vehicle look inside the wheel arches (carry a small torch with you
if necessary) and look more closely at the under surface below the passenger
compartment. Open the vehicle from the passenger's side and release the bonnet
catch. Lift the bonnet and scan the interior of the engine compartment,
especially the rear side. In the passenger compartment look under seats and
under the dashboard, and in the boot look in the spare wheel well. But remember,
if you do not see what obviously appears to be an explosive device during a
cursory search like this it does not mean that your vehicle is not
booby-trapped. However, doing this is better than not doing it.</p>
<p>It must be repeated that there is no substitute for vigilance and having the
correct attitude toward vehicle bombs. Burglar alarms can give a false sense of
security and letting one's guard drop can be disastrous.</p>
<p><b>WHAT TO LOOK FOR</b></p>
<p>In the movies the star always discovers the bomb because the villain has been
shoddy and left wires sticking out or bits of wire under the car. This is
unlikely to happen in the real world. Our enemy is sophisticated and has access
to all the latest techniques of bomb-making. It is unlikely that the bomber will
construct the bomb at the vehicle - this is too dangerous and the chances of
being observed are greatly increased. The enemy will know what kind of car the
target individual owns or uses and a bomb will be prepared beforehand for that
specific make of vehicle. This will enable the placer to attach the bomb quickly
and without any danger to him or herself. If efforts have been taken to reduce
the number of placement areas the enemy's plans may be thwarted.</p>
<p>There are many misconceptions about the appearance of car-bombs. More likely
than not the bomb will not be half a dozen sticks of dynamite tied together as
they are in the cop movies. It is more likely that TNT or plastic explosive will
be used and that the bomb will be inside some sort of container complete with
its detonating mechanism.</p>
<p>A bomb need only be very small. A 200 gm block of TNT the size of a bar of
soap is sufficient to kill someone if placed directly under or near the victim.
Common charges are one or two kilograms, but they may be very much bigger if
place in the boot or under a seat. Plastic explosive can be moulded into any
shape but will probably be placed inside some container which will probably also
contain the firing mechanism. Plastic can be secreted inside any hollow space in
the vehicle. This is why these areas must be eliminated as far as possible.</p>
<p>The most likely locations for the explosive charge will be near where the
victim is likely to sit. This means under a seat, in the door nearest the
seating position or directly in front of or behind the seat. The bomb could of
course be placed anywhere if it is powerful enough. By far the most common
locations are on or in external areas which can be reached without needing to
open anything, or at the rear of the engine compartment (if the engine is in
front).</p>
<p>It is impossible to say exactly what a bomb will look like as there are so
many ways of making them, and they can in any case be disguised. Look for wires
running to objects in which explosives could have been placed. If the vehicle's
own electrics is being used to detonate the bomb one wire will be connected
directly to the bodywork or some other metallic part of the vehicle. The other
wire will probably lead to the switch or detonating device and then to another
wire of the vehicle's electrical circuit. It is probable that bomb wires will be
of a different colour to the vehicle's wires or they may just be cleaner. If
separate batteries are being used these will probably be sealed inside a
container with the explosive or attached by a pair of wires not connected to the
vehicle's wiring in any way.</p>
<p>Most vehicles do not have many loose wires in the engine compartment and
other places. Wires are usually bound together or are part of a harness. Get to
know which are the normally loose wires so that if you see any others they could
be connected to a remote timing or triggering component, trip wires or pressure
plate.</p>
<p><b>DISCOVERING AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE</b></p>
<p>Should you discover what appears to be an explosive device never attempt to
defuse or remove it on your own. If possible call the police; if not possible,
call an expert and clear the area.</p>
<p>Do not attempt to disconnect wires or the vehicle's own battery should you
see that the bomb is connected to the wiring circuit. The bomb may be fitted
with a collapsing-circuit switch which would detonate when disconnected. This is
a switch which is held open by the vehicle's own current but which closes when
the current is withdrawn.</p>

<h3>5. <a name="PACKAGE">PACKAGE</a> BOMBS</h3>
<p>The enemy has for a long time made use of letter and parcel bombs to attack
our members, and there is no reason to expect them to cease using this method of
eliminating or incapacitating specific members in the future.</p>
<p>Letter and parcel bombs are most likely to be directed at the leadership of
our organisation or at identified active members, but this is not their only
use. A parcel bomb can be constructed powerfully enough to cause considerable
damage if it explodes inside a building.</p>
<p>There are certain stereotyped ideas of how letter and parcel bombs are
constructed, look and are used. Armed with only this scanty knowledge we leave
ourselves open to deception and hence to all the dangers inherent in these
devices. We must constantly remind ourselves that our enemy is powerful and
sophisticated and will resort to every devious means to deceive us. New and
progressively more ingenious devices will be devised to overcome the known
methods for detecting these types of bombs. For this reason it is of the utmost
importance that the enemy should not know what precautions we take to protect
ourselves from such devices and what steps we take to minimise their effects
should one go off. Whatever protective equipment is used should be unknown to
all except those authorised to use it; and whatever procedures are used to
handle mail and other deliveries should remain absolutely confidential.</p>
<p><b>Types of parcel and letter bombs</b></p>
<p>Letter and parcel bombs (from here on called 'package bombs') can take a wide
variety of forms, limited only by the bomb-maker's imagination. Package bombs
are not necessarily designed to kill. They are often designed to main, injure or
simply cause damage to property (by fire or explosion).</p>
<p>Package bombs can be divided into two basic groups:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Incendiary or low-explosive bombs</li>
  <li>Commercial and military high-explosive bombs.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>1. INCENDIARY AND LOW-EXPLOSIVE BOMBS:</b></p>
<p>These bombs have charges which are usually made from easily obtainable
chemical powders which are simply mixed together. Examples of such mixtures are
gunpowder, various 'black powders', oxidising agents with oil, and 'flash
powders'.</p>
<p><b>1.1 Incendiary bombs:</b></p>
<p>These are designed to cause injury or damage through a flash or fire rather
than by explosion.</p>
<p>Virtually all methods of ignition or detonation used for other types of bombs
can be used with incendiary bombs, but because they need only a spark, flash or
flame to be ignited, some very simple methods of initiation can be used, which
make this type of bomb very hard to detect.</p>
<p><b>1.2 Low-explosive bombs:</b></p>
<p>Most incendiary mixtures are in fact low explosives. When packed loosely in
an envelope or some other weak container, the action of low explosives when
ignited is to flash rather than explode. When a low explosive is packed in a
container which offers more resistance to the expanding gases liberated by
ignition, an explosion occurs. The more rigid the container the more powerful
the explosion.</p>
<p>Any ignition method used for an incendiary bomb can be used for a
low-explosive bomb. However, because of the need for a low-explosive bomb to
have a rigid container, electrical firing mechanisms would probably be preferred
as they are more reliable.</p>
<p>Low-explosive bombs can, if they are sufficiently large, be lethal. But
because of the quantity of explosive needed to make one powerful enough to kill,
their function would probably be to maim the victim. It is not too probable that
our enemy would use bombs charged with low explosives as these would be bulky
and arouse suspicion. It cannot be ruled out that other cranks in the service of
our enemy may use low-explosive bombs. A low explosive can be made by anyone
with chemicals which are freely available. They are easy to set off and do not
need commercial or military detonators.</p>
<p><b>2. COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY HIGH EXPLOSIVES</b></p>
<p>Low explosives are mere mixtures of various separate chemicals, whereas in
high explosives the various chemicals out of which they are made are bonded into
a unitary compound. Because there are no air spaces between the chemicals they
can react immediately with each other. This increases the explosion velocity
considerably and accounts for the greater power of high explosives.</p>
<p>Low explosives work by creating large volumes of gases very rapidly. These
expanding gases cause the blasting effect of low explosives. To increase the
pressures rigid containers are used. High explosives do not work so much by
creating hot gases under pressure, but by a powerful shock wave which is created
when they explode. For this reason high explosives do not need any container to
be effective. There are a number of other differences between low and high
explosives, but these need not concern us here. All that needs to be known is
that high explosives are much more powerful and hence more dangerous than low
explosives. Only small quantities are required for the same effect.</p>
<p>The difference between commercial and military high explosives is that the
former are available to licensed commercial users, whereas military explosives
are restricted to military users. Military explosives are generally more
powerful and are packaged in ways which make them far more suitable for use in
package bombs.</p>
<p><b>2.1 Commercial high-explosive bombs:</b></p>
<p>It is not very likely that our enemy would use these types of explosives,
despite the fact that they are fairly freely available. The form in which they
are supplied does not render them suitable for concealment in small packages.
Dynamite comes in paper-covered sticks which are fairly bulky. The explosive can
be removed from its paper covering, but since dynamite is rather mud-like it has
to be placed inside some other leak-proof container. Nitro-glycerine is a thick
oily liquid and is far too unstable to be used on its own. Gelignite also comes
in sticks, whereas smokeless powders are used as propellants in gun cartridges.</p>
<p>The various methods of detonation will be dealt with in the next section;
suffice it to say that all commercial high explosives need a proper blasting cap
(detonator) for initiation. A blasting cap is a short copper or aluminium tube
about 40mm long and 8mm in diameter. They come in two types: electrical and
non-electrical. Non-electrical caps are set off with a piece of ordinary
black-powder safety fuse. This has to be lit with a flame, so they are not
likely to be used in package bombs. An electrical blasting cap contains a few
grams of high explosive and an electrical bridgewire. When the cap is connected
to a battery or some other source of electricity, the bridgewire glows in much
the same way as the filament of a bulb. This causes the cap to explode, which in
turn detonates the surrounding explosive into which it is placed.</p>
<p><b>2.2 Military high-explosive bombs:</b></p>
<p>There is a great variety of military explosives, but the two most common
types used in letter and parcel bombs are TNT and plastic explosive.</p>
<p>TNT comes in 200 gm blocks about the size of a bar of soap. It can be cut
down to any size that is wanted. TNT is a hard substance and to detonate it a
blasting cap has to be inserted inside the block or piece. Usually there is a
hole in the side of the block into which the blasting cap fits.</p>
<p>Plastic explosive is by far the most suitable explosive for package bombs. It
is like plasticine or putty and can be moulded into any shape. It can be rolled
into flat sheets or inserted into any hollow object in order to disguise it. It
is one of the most powerful explosives in use, sometimes as much as twice as
powerful as TNT for the same weight. Only a small quantity is needed to make a
lethal bomb. For instance, 100gm of plastic explosive is sufficient to cut a
railway line. A blasting cap which contains 2gm of relatively weak explosive is
enough to blow off your hand. A letter containing 20gm of plastic explosive can
thus inflict serious injury. A parcel with a few hundred grams means certain
death.</p>
<p><b>HOW THEY WORK</b></p>
<p>Practically all package bombs are set off by the act of opening them. This
need not necessarily be the case, however. A package could be timed to go off
after a certain period, even before it is opened, such as at the time when it is
due to be delivered. Others which are disguised as a gift, for instance, might
be timed to go off some time after they have been opened.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of different ways of making package bombs go off, but this
should not intimidate us as most work on the same principle. Often the shape of
the package will inform us of the probable method used.</p>
<p>As explained, incendiary and low-explosive bombs do not require detonators to
be ignited and may be set off by a spark or flash. They therefore do not need
batteries, wires and switches as part of their firing system.</p>
<p>The inside of an ordinary Christmas cracker can be used to initiate a low
explosive. The one end of the cracker can be fixed to a smaller envelope and the
other end to the inside of a larger envelope. As the smaller envelope is pulled
out the flash from the cracker can ignite the explosive. Even a match can be
used by having it scrape against a piece of matchbox side as a package is opened
or something moved from inside the package.</p>
<p>High explosives need a detonator to be initiated and since the explosion,
usually, needs to take place at the precise moment the package is opened, they
are fired electrically. The electrical circuits of such bombs are very simple. A
battery is connected to the detonator by wires. On one of the wires is a switch.
The act of opening the package closes the switch. This completes the circuit and
the detonator fires.</p>
<p>Every bomb wired in this fashion also needs some sort of setting or arming
mechanism which prevents the bomb-maker from being blown up before the package
is closed. This usually takes the form of another switch in the circuit which is
open when the firing switch is closed, but which can be closed after the bomb
has been sealed or shut or while it is being sealed or shut. Another method is
to fit a timing device to the circuit which closes the second switch after the
bomb has been dispatched to the target recipient.</p>
<p>Knowledge of this is important because often package bombs have tell-tale
signs which are the result of this need to have some form of activating
mechanism.</p>
<p><b>EXAMPLES OF PACKAGE BOMBS</b></p>
<p>A few examples are mentioned here to give some idea of how package bombs are
constructed.</p>
<p>Many package bombs work by the action of removing one object from the inside
of another, such as taking a smaller envelope out of a larger one. This action
can cause two ends of an electrical circuit to make contact. Sometimes one
object inside another simply holds apart a spring-loaded pair of contacts.
Imagine for example a clothes peg which has been fitted with metal contacts in
its jaws being held apart by a small envelope in a larger one. As the smaller
envelope is pulled out the jaws would snap together and contact be made. More
sophisticated switches based on this simple idea are common in package bombs.</p>
<p>Another common switch in package bombs is a pressure-release switch. These
are spring-loaded switches which are held open by a lid on a container or by the
flap of an envelope. As the lid is removed or the flap opened the switch springs
out and makes contact.</p>
<p>Very common in book bombs are reed switches. These are very delicate and
sensitive switches that are held open by a small magnet. When the magnet is
moved away from the switch the switch closes and contact is made. Book bombs
have an area hollowed out in the middle of them between the covers. In this
hollow the explosive, the battery and the switch are placed. The magnet is fixed
to the front cover while the switch is fixed to the back cover. When the book is
opened the magnet moves away from the switch and the switch closes. A hollowed
out bundle of magazines or papers could work in the same fashion.</p>
<p>Many other ingenious 'switches' have been and can be used in package bombs.
For instance a package could be wrapped in two layers of aluminium foil
insulated from each other and then covered in paper. The two ends of the
electrical circuit could be attached to each of the layers of foil. As the cover
is ripped off the layers of foil would touch and contact be made.</p>
<p><b>HANDLING PROCEDURES AND DETECTION METHODS</b></p>
<p>There are several technical means of detecting package bombs but metal
detectors, explosives' vapour detectors and X-ray scanners are the most common.
Before looking at these in more detail, we must first look at the most important
method of all - the COMMON SENSE METHOD.</p>
<p>The common sense method requires no equipment at all - it means the
development of a correct attitude to the possibility of receiving a package bomb
and the establishment of regular procedures for the handling of deliveries of
every kind.</p>
<p>Most people during the course of their lives receive hundreds of letters,
parcels and deliveries, yet only one of these is enough to blow you to pieces.
Thus, our greatest enemy is letting our guard drop by not constantly reminding
ourselves that we are enemy targets and that every object we receive might be
potentially lethal. The following is a list of DOs and DON'Ts that should be
observed by everyone, whether they have technical equipment to assist them or
not:</p>
<ol>
  <li>DO remind yourself every time you receive an item of post or A DELIVERY OF
    ANY KIND that it might be dangerous.</li>
  <li>DO develop procedures for the handling of regular deliveries, such as the
    post. Separate all items which could not possibly contain anything harmful,
    such as postcards and very thin letters. If in doubt, hold the letter up to
    a strong light. Heavier items should be put aside and treated as suspect.</li>
  <li>DON'T let anyone else know what procedures or methods you use to handle or
    detect bombs, as the enemy might find out and use this information against
    you in the future.</li>
  <li>DO treat as suspect any delivery large enough to contain something
    dangerous, no matter where it comes from or how it arrives.</li>
  <li>DO study the address on any postal item before you open it. If possible,
    make a note of who posted it, when and from where.</li>
  <li>DON'T consider an item safe because it comes from a known source, because
    you recognise the handwriting, because it is a regular delivery or because
    you were expecting it. The enemy can intercept our post and booby-trap it.</li>
  <li>DON'T stereotype package bombs. They can be any size and shape. A few
    grams of high explosive can be very harmful and new almost undetectable
    methods of detonation might be used.</li>
  <li>DO inspect carefully any suspect item before you open it.</li>
  <li>DON'T open suspect envelopes before feeling the contents. Do not bend an
    envelope. Gently move your hand across the side. If you feel a round object
    a little thinner than a pencil and about 3 - 4 cm long, it could be a
    detonator. Other hard objects could be batteries and switches.</li>
  <li>DON'T poke into a package with metal objects as this could cause a short
    circuit and fire the bomb.</li>
  <li>DON'T open packages in the way that you are supposed to. The bomb-maker
    has made certain assumptions about the way you are expected to open a
    package. If you open it in an unconventional way you may avoid activating
    the triggering mechanism and you may see that it is booby-trapped. But be
    careful.</li>
  <li>DO open packages very carefully, noting how they are sealed. Tight flaps,
    openings, lids, string or tape might be holding pressure-release switches.</li>
  <li>DON'T pull smaller envelopes out of larger ones until you are sure they
    are not attached in some way. If there is any resistance the inner envelope
    might be booby-trapped.</li>
  <li>DO always use remote means of opening where possible. Attach a long piece
    of string to anything that has to be pulled or lifted and pull it from a
    safe distance.</li>
  <li>DON'T submerge a suspected bomb in water. Water is a good conductor and
    might short circuit a switch. The water might also react with the chemicals.</li>
  <li>DO, where possible, take suspected packages to the police. Where this is
    not possible, open the package in a safe place by remote methods.</li>
  <li>DO, where possible, make use of detection equipment, but remember, these
    are only aids and not infallible. Their use does not let you off taking the
    aforementioned precautions.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>BOMB DETECTION EQUIPMENT</b></p>
<p>If you acquire any special equipment to detect package and other types of
bombs, it must be remembered that such equipment is only an aid and can never
replace the common sense approach. It is very easy for expensive and
fancy-looking equipment to give us a false sense of security. Every method has
its advantages and its shortcomings. Each type of equipment detects certain
kinds of bombs better than the other types of equipment, but none are able to
detect all types of bombs. There is no infallible piece of equipment.</p>
<p><b>1. Metal Detectors:</b></p>
<p>As the name indicates, these can only detect bombs where metal is present.
Although this is the case, a metal detector is useless if the bomb is contained
in a metal container, such as a tin, or if it is wrapped in foil. Also, if a
bomb is placed deep inside, say, a large wooden box, the distance will be too
far for the metal detector to register.</p>
<p>Metal detectors are the cheapest form of detection equipment available.
Simple metal detectors used by builders to locate pipes and wires in walls are
perfectly adequate for the purpose. Metal detectors are simply swept over the
surface of suspect items and give off a tone or a light comes on when they are
brought near metal. Although most of them are sensitive enough to pick up
staples and paper-clips, this is not a shortcoming because one soon learns to
identify these things by the way their presence is identified.</p>
<p><b>2. Explosives Vapour Detectors:</b></p>
<p>These work by bringing the device near to a suspect package. They draw in
samples of air and 'analyse' these for the presence of the vapours given off by
high explosives.</p>
<p>They cannot detect low explosive chemical mixtures because, in most cases,
these give off no vapours. High explosives are hydrocarbon compounds which give
off vapours in various amounts. Commercial explosives give off copious vapours
while some military explosives give off very little.</p>
<p>Cheaper vapour detectors can only detect commercial explosives, while the
more expensive versions can detect many, but not all kinds of military high
explosives. The price of even the cheaper versions is way beyond the pocket of
the average person. The more sophisticated versions are exceedingly expensive.</p>
<p>The major drawback with vapour detectors is that they cannot detect low
explosives, and high explosives can be sealed inside airtight containers from
which no vapours can leak.</p>
<p><b>3. X-ray Scanners:</b></p>
<p>These are the most expensive bomb detectors, but in many ways the best. Being
able to see directly inside a package is very reassuring.</p>
<p>An X-ray scanner is usually a sort of cabinet into which the suspect package
is placed. X-rays are passed through the object and an image is created on a
mirror. The investigator views this through a window (the screen).</p>
<p>The major drawback with an X-ray scanner is that only metal objects show up
properly on the screen. Bombs without metal parts or wires could pass through
undetected. This is because an X-ray image is really a shadow. The object in the
path of the X-rays absorbs some of the X-rays as they pass through. Paper and
even thick cardboard hardly absorb any X-rays at all and therefore cast no
shadow. Metal on the other hand absorbs practically all X-rays and therefore
casts a heavy shadow.</p>
<p>Another danger is that it is possible to create a bomb which is set off by
the presence of X-rays. This is one reason why it should be kept a tightly
guarded secret which detecting methods you use, as the enemy could use this
information against you.</p>
<p><b>WHAT TO LOOK FOR</b></p>
<p>In the section on DOs and DON'Ts it was stressed that package bombs should
never be stereotyped. There are no general characteristics by which they can be
identified and size is no give-away. A very small letter bomb can be constructed
and, remember, only a few grams of high explosive are needed to injure you.</p>
<p>Despite all this, there are often signs which might indicate that a package
is a bomb. Ask yourself the following questions each time you receive a letter,
package or delivery of any kind:</p>
<ol>
  <li>How did this letter/package/delivery get to me? Was it a normal delivery,
    was it expected, did it arrive out of the blue?</li>
  <li>Where did this letter or package come from? Do I normally get
    letters/packages from this address? Check the postmark and sender's address
    (if any).</li>
  <li>How long has it taken to reach me from the time it was posted? Has it
    taken too long to get to me? Check the date stamp.</li>
  <li>Does the package look as if it has been opened? If it is an item you
    receive regularly, is it packaged in exactly the way you always receive it
    or is something different?</li>
  <li>Does it have stains on the outside? Many explosives are oily and if not
    properly packaged can leak through an envelope or wrapper.</li>
  <li>Does it have a strange smell? Many explosives have a distinctive aroma -
    often of marzipan or almonds.</li>
  <li>How would the bomb-maker have armed the bomb if one were inside? Look for
    holes, flaps stuck down, disguised openings, pieces of wire, string, etc.</li>
  <li>Is it too heavy for what it is supposed to be?</li>
  <li>Does it feel unbalanced or lopsided?</li>
  <li>Does anything rattle, move or shake inside? Are there objects inside which
    should not be there? Tap, shake and gently feel every delivery.</li>
  <li>Is the letter/package very securely sealed? Too much tape or unnecessary
    string? Study the envelope/wrapping.</li>
  <li>Are there any wires, bits of string or anything else observable through
    the flap or wrapping? Lift flaps and wrappers carefully to see if they are
    hiding anything.</li>
  <li>How am I meant to open this? Open packages in unconventional ways, not how
    you are supposed to. But be careful: look first so that you don't
    accidentally set off a triggering mechanism by damaging it.</li>
</ol>
